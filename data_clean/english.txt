source for completely reliable information about god what happens when we die and where history is headed the bible does these things because it is god s inspired word inerrant in the original manuscripts bible translation brings god s word from the ancient languages hebrew greek and aramaic into today s world in dependence on god s spirit to accomplish this sacred task the christian standard bible translation oversight committee and holman bible publishers present the csb textual base of the csb the textual base for the new testament nt is the nestle-aland novum testamentum graece th edition and the united bible societies greek new testament th corrected edition the text for the old testament ot is the biblia hebraica stuttgartensia th edition where there are significant differences among hebrew aramaic or greek manuscripts the translators follow what they believe is the original reading and indicate the main alternative s in footnotes the csb uses the traditional verse divisions found in most protestant bibles goals of this translation provide english-speaking people worldwide with an accurate translation in contemporary english provide an accurate translation for personal study sermon preparation private devotions and memorization provide a text that is clear and understandable suitable for public reading and shareable so that all may access its life-giving message affirm the authority of scripture and champion its absolute truth against skeptical viewpoints translation philosophy of the csb most discussions of bible translations speak of two opposite approaches formal equivalence and dynamic equivalence this terminology is meaningful but bible translations cannot be neatly sorted into these two categories there is room for another category of translation philosophy that capitalizes on the strengths of the other two formal equivalence often called word-for-word or literal translation the principle of formal equivalence seeks as nearly as possible to preserve the structure of the original language it seeks to represent each word of the original text with an exact equivalent word in the translation so that the reader can see word for word what the original human author wrote the merits of this approach include its consistency with the conviction that the holy spirit did inspire the very words of scripture in the original manuscripts it also provides the english bible student some access to the structure of the text in the original language formal equivalence can achieve accuracy to the degree that english has an exact equivalent for each word and that the grammatical patterns of the original language can be reproduced in understandable english however it can sometimes result in awkward if not incomprehensible english or in a misunderstanding of the author s intent the literal rendering of ancient idioms is especially difficult dynamic or functional equivalence often called thought-for-thought translation the principle of dynamic equivalence rejects as misguided the attempt to preserve the structure of the original language it proceeds by extracting the meaning of a text from its form and then translating that meaning so that it makes the same impact on modern readers that the ancient text made on its original readers strengths of this approach include a high degree of clarity and readability especially in places where the original is difficult to render word for word it also csb_pew_bible indb pm vi acknowledges that accurate and effective translation may require interpretation however the meaning of a text cannot always be neatly separated from its form nor can it always be precisely determined a biblical author may have intended multiple meanings but these may be lost with the elimination of normal structures in striving for readability dynamic equivalence also sometimes overlooks and loses some of the less prominent elements of meaning furthermore lack of formal correspondence to the original makes it difficult to verify accuracy and thus can affect the usefulness of the translation for in-depth bible study optimal equivalence in practice translations are seldom if ever purely formal or dynamic but favor one theory of bible translation or the other to varying degrees optimal equivalence as a translation philosophy recognizes that form cannot always be neatly separated from meaning and should not be changed for example nouns to verbs or second person you to third person they unless comprehension demands it the primary goal of translation is to convey the sense of the original with as much clarity as the original text and the translation language permit optimal equivalence appreciates the goals of formal equivalence but also recognizes its limitations optimal equivalence starts with an exhaustive analysis of the text at every level word phrase clause sentence discourse in the original language to determine its original meaning and intention or purpose then relying on the latest and best language tools and experts the nearest corresponding semantic and linguistic equivalents are used to convey as much of the information and intention of the original text with as much clarity and readability as possible this process assures the maximum transfer of both the words and the thoughts contained in the original the csb uses optimal equivalence as its translation philosophy in the many places throughout the bible where a word-for-word rendering is understandable a literal translation is used when a word-for-word rendering might obscure the meaning for a modern audience a more dynamic translation is used the csb places equal value on fidelity to the original and readability for a modern audience resulting in a translation that achieves both goals the gender language usage in bible translation the goal of the translators of the csb has not been to promote a cultural ideology but to translate the bible faithfully recognizing modern usage of english the csb regularly translates the plural of the greek word ανθρωπος man as people instead of men and occasionally the singular as one someone or everyone when the supporting pronouns in the original languages validate such a translation while the csb avoids using he or him unnecessarily the translation does not restructure sentences to avoid them when they are in the text history of the csb after several years of preliminary development holman bible publishers the oldest bible publisher in north america assembled an international interdenominational team of scholars editors stylists and proofreaders all of whom were committed to biblical inerrancy outside consultants and reviewers contributed valuable suggestions from their areas of expertise working with the original languages an executive team of translators edited polished and reviewed the final manuscript that was first published as the holman christian standard bible hcsb in a standing committee was also formed to maintain the hcsb translation and look for ways to improve readability without compromising accuracy as with the original translation team the committee that prepared this revision of the hcsb renamed the csb is international and interdenominational comprised of evangelical scholars who honor the inspiration and authority of god s written word traditional features found in the csb in keeping with a long line of bible publications the csb has retained a number of features found in traditional bibles traditional theological vocabulary for example justification sanctification csb_pew_bible indb pm vii redemption has been retained since such terms have no other translation equivalent that adequately communicates their exact meaning traditional spellings of names and places found in most bibles have been used to make the csb compatible with most bible study tools some editions of the csb will print the words of christ in red letters to help readers easily locate the spoken words of the lord jesus christ descriptive headings printed above each section of scripture help readers quickly identify the contents of that section ot passages quoted in the nt are indicated in the csb they are set in boldface type how the names of god are translated the csb consistently translates the hebrew names for god as follows hebrew

indb pm genesis the creation in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth a now the earth was formless and empty darkness covered the surface of the watery depths and the spirit of god was hovering over the surface of the waters then god said let there be light and there was light god saw that the light was good and god separated the light from the darkness god called the light day and the darkness he called night there was an evening and there was a morning one day then god said let there be an expanse between the waters separating water from water so god made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse and it was so god called the expanse sky b evening came and then morning the second day then god said let the water under the sky be gathered into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so god called the dry land earth and the gathering of the water he called seas and god saw that it was good then god said let the earth produce vegetation seed-bearing plants and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds and it was so the earth produced vegetation seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds and god saw that it was good evening came and then morning the third day then god said let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night they will serve as signs for seasons c and for days and years they will be lights in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth and it was so god made the two great lights the greater light to rule over the day and the lesser light to rule over the night as well as the stars god placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth to rule the day and the night and to separate light from darkness and god saw that it was good evening came and then morning the fourth day then god said let the water swarm with d living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky so god created the large sea-creatures e and every living creature that moves and swarms in the water according to their kinds he also created every winged creature according to its kind and god saw that it was good god blessed them be fruitful multiply and fill the waters of the seas and let the birds multiply on the earth evening came and then morning the fifth day then god said let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds livestock creatures that crawl and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds and it was so so god made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds the livestock according to their kinds and all the creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds and god saw that it was good then god said let us make man f in g our image according to our likeness they will rule the fish of the sea the birds of the sky the livestock the whole earth h and the creatures that crawl i on the earth so god created man in his own image he created him in j the image of god he created them male and female god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful multiply fill the earth and subdue it rule the fish of the sea the birds of the sky and every creature that crawls k on the earth god also said look i have given you every seed-bearing plant on the surface of the entire earth and every tree whose fruit contains seed this will be food for you for all the wildlife of the earth for every bird of the sky and for every creature that crawls on the

declared it holy for on it he rested from all his work of creation c man and woman in the garden these are the records of the heavens and the earth concerning their creation at the time d that the lord god made the earth and the heavens no shrub of the field had yet grown on the land e and no plant of the field had yet sprouted for the lord god had not made it rain on the land and there was no man to work the ground but mist would come up from the earth and water all the ground then the lord god formed the man out of the dust from the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and the man became a living being the lord god planted a garden in eden in the east and there he placed the man he had formed the lord god caused to grow out of the ground every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food including the tree of life in the middle of the garden as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil a river went f out from eden to water the garden from there it divided and became the source of four rivers g the name of the first is pishon which flows through the entire land of havilah h where there is gold gold from that land is pure i bdellium j and onyx k are also there the name of the second river is gihon which flows through the entire land of cush the name of the third river is tigris which runs east of assyria and the fourth river is the euphrates the lord god took the man and placed him in the garden of eden to work it and watch over it and the lord god commanded the man you are free to eat from any tree of the garden but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for on the day you eat from it you will certainly die then the lord god said it is not good for the man to be alone i will make a helper corresponding to him the lord god formed out of the ground every wild animal and every bird of the sky and brought each to the man to see what he would call it and whatever the man called a living creature that was its name the man gave names to all the livestock to the birds of the sky and to every wild animal but for the man l no helper was found corresponding to him so the lord god caused a deep sleep to come over the man and he slept god took one of his ribs and closed the flesh at that place then the lord god made the rib he had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man and the man said this one at last is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh this one will be called woman for she was taken from man this is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife and they become one flesh both the man and his wife were naked yet felt no shame the temptation and the fall now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the lord god had made he said to the woman did god really say you can t eat from any tree in the garden the woman said to the serpent we may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god said you must not eat it or touch it or you will die no you will not die the serpent said to the woman in fact god knows that when m you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god n knowing good and evil the woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom so she took some of its fruit and ate it she also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it then the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew they were naked so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves

commanded you not to eat from the man replied the woman you gave to be with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and i ate so the lord god asked the woman what is this you have done and the woman said the serpent deceived me and i ate so the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are cursed more than any livestock and more than any wild animal you will move on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life i will put hostility between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring he will strike your head and you will strike his heel he said to the woman i will intensify your labor pains you will bear children with painful effort your desire will be for your husband yet he will rule over you and he said to the man because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which i commanded you do not eat from it the ground is cursed because of you you will eat from it by means of painful labor c all the days of your life it will produce thorns and thistles for you and you will eat the plants of the field you will eat bread d by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground since you were taken from it for you are dust and you will return to dust the man named his wife eve e because she was the mother of all the living the lord god made clothing from skins for the man and his wife and he clothed them the lord god said since the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil he must not reach out take from the tree of life eat and live forever so the lord god sent him away from the garden of eden to work the ground from which he was taken he drove the man out and stationed the cherubim and the flaming whirling sword east of the garden of eden to guard the way to the tree of life cain murders abel the man was intimate with his wife eve and she conceived and gave birth to cain she said i have had a male child with the lord s help f she also gave birth to his brother abel now abel became a shepherd of flocks

cain so that whoever found him would not kill him then cain went out from the lord s presence and lived in the land of nod east of eden the line of cain cain was intimate with his wife and she

build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky let us make a name for ourselves otherwise we will be scattered throughout the earth then the lord came down to look over the city and the tower that the humans k were building the lord said if they have begun to do this as one people all having the same language then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them come let s go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another s speech so from there the lord scattered them throughout the earth and they stopped building the city therefore it is

of the chaldeans to go to the land of canaan but when they came to haran they settled there terah lived years and died in haran the call of abram the lord said to abram go out from your land your relatives and your father s house to the land that i will show you i will make you into a great nation i will bless you i will make your name great and you will be a blessing i will bless those who bless you i will curse anyone who treats you with contempt and all the peoples a on earth will be blessed b through you c so abram went as the lord had told him and lot went with him abram was seventy- five years old when he left haran he took his wife sarai his nephew lot all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in haran and they set out for the land of canaan when they came to the land of canaan abram passed through the land to the site of shechem at the oak of moreh at that time the canaanites were in the land the lord appeared to abram and said to your offspring i will give this land so he built an altar there to the lord who had appeared to him from there he moved on to the hill country east of bethel and pitched his tent with bethel on the west and ai on the east he built an altar to the lord there and he called on the name of the lord then abram journeyed by stages to the negev abram in egypt there was a famine in the land so abram went down to egypt to stay there for a while because the famine in the land was severe when he was about to enter egypt he said to his wife sarai look i know what a beautiful woman you are when the egyptians see you they will say this is his wife they will kill me but let you live please say you re my sister so it will go well for me because of you and my life will be spared on your account when abram entered egypt the egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful pharaoh s officials saw her and praised her to pharaoh so the woman was taken to pharaoh s household he treated abram well because of her and abram acquired flocks and herds male and female donkeys male and female slaves and camels but the lord struck pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of abram s wife sarai so pharaoh sent for abram and said what have you done to me why didn t you tell me she was your wife why did you say she s my sister so that i took her as my wife now here is your wife take her and go then pharaoh gave his men orders about him and they sent him away with his wife and all he had abram and lot separate abram went up from egypt to the negev he his wife and all he had and lot with him abram was very rich in livestock silver and gold he went by stages from the negev to bethel to the place between bethel and ai where his tent had formerly been to the site where he had built the altar and abram called on the name of the lord there now lot who was traveling with abram also had flocks herds and tents but the land was unable to support them as long as they stayed together for they had so many possessions that they could not stay together and there was quarreling between the herdsmen of abram s livestock and the herdsmen of lot s a lit clans b or will find blessing c or will bless themselves by you genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm livestock at that time the canaanites and the perizzites were living in the land so abram said to lot please let s not have quarreling between you and me or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen since we are relatives a isn t the whole land before you separate from me if you go to the left i will go to the right if you go to the right i will go to the left lot looked out and saw that the entire plain b of the jordan as far as c zoar was well watered everywhere like the lord s garden and the land of egypt this was before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah so lot chose the entire plain of the jordan for himself then lot journeyed eastward and they separated from each other abram lived in the land of canaan but lot lived in the cities on the plain and set up his tent near sodom now the men of sodom were evil sinning immensely d against the lord after lot had separated from him the lord said to abram look from the place where you are look north and south east and west for i will give you and your offspring forever all the land that you see i will make your offspring like the dust of the earth so that if anyone could count the dust of the earth then your offspring could be counted get up and walk around the land through its length and width for i will give it to you so abram moved his tent and went to live near the oaks of mamre at hebron where he built an altar to the lord abram rescues lot in those days king amraphel of shinar king arioch of ellasar king chedorlaomer of elam and king tidal of goiim e waged war against king bera of sodom king birsha of gomorrah king shinab of admah and king shemeber of zeboiim as well as the king of bela that is zoar all of these came as allies to the siddim valley that is the dead sea they were subject to chedorlaomer for twelve years but in the thirteenth year they rebelled in the fourteenth year chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the rephaim in ashteroth- karnaim the zuzim in ham the emim in shaveh-kiriathaim and the horites in the mountains of seir as far as el-paran by the wilderness then they came back to invade en-mishpat that is kadesh and they defeated the whole territory of the amalekites as well as the amorites who lived in hazazon-tamar then the king of sodom the king of gomorrah the king of admah the king of zeboiim and the king of bela that is zoar went out and lined up for battle in the siddim valley against king chedorlaomer of elam king tidal of goiim king amraphel of shinar and king arioch of ellasar four kings against five now the siddim valley contained many asphalt pits and as the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled some fell into them f but the rest fled to the mountains the four kings took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their food and went on they also took abram s nephew lot and his possessions for he was living in sodom and they went on one of the survivors came and told abram the hebrew who lived near the oaks belonging to mamre the amorite the brother of eshcol and the brother of aner they were bound by a treaty with g abram when abram heard that his relative had been taken prisoner he assembled h his trained men born in his household and they went in pursuit as far as dan and he and his servants deployed against them by night defeated them and pursued them as far as hobah to the north of damascus he brought back all the goods and also his relative lot and his goods as well as the women and the other people melchizedek s blessing after abram returned from defeating chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him the king of sodom went out to meet him in the shaveh valley that is the king s valley melchizedek king of salem i brought out bread and wine he was a priest to god most high he blessed him and said abram is blessed by god most high creator j of heaven and earth and blessed be god most high who has handed over your enemies to you and abram

not take a thread or sandal strap or anything that belongs to you so you can never say i made abram rich i will take nothing a except what the servants have eaten but as for the share of the men who came with me aner eshcol and mamre they can take their share the abrahamic covenant after these events the word of the lord came to abram in a vision do not be afraid abram i am your shield your reward will be very great but abram said lord god what can you give me since i am childless and the heir of my house is eliezer of damascus b abram continued look you have given me no offspring so a slave born in c my house will be my heir now the word of the lord came to him this one will not be your heir instead one who comes from your own body d will be your heir he took him outside and said look at the sky and count the stars if you are able to count them then he said to him your offspring will be that numerous abram believed the lord and he credited it to him as righteousness he also said to him i am the lord who brought you from ur of the chaldeans to give you this land to possess but he said lord god how can i know that i will possess it he said to him bring me a three-year-old cow a three-year-old female goat a three-yearold ram a turtledove and a young pigeon so he brought all these to him cut them in half and laid the pieces opposite each other but he did not cut the birds in half birds of prey came down on the carcasses but abram drove them away as the sun was setting a deep sleep came over abram and suddenly great terror and darkness descended on him then the lord said to abram know this for certain your offspring will be resident aliens for four hundred years in a land that does not belong to them and will be enslaved and oppressed e however i will judge the nation they serve and afterward they will go out with many possessions but you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age in the fourth generation they will return here for the iniquity of the amorites has not yet reached its full measure f when the sun had set and it was dark a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals on that day the lord made a covenant with abram saying i give this land to your offspring from the brook of egypt to the great river the euphrates river the land of the kenites kenizzites kadmonites hethites perizzites rephaim amorites canaanites girgashites and jebusites hagar and ishmael abram s wife sarai had not borne any children for him but she owned an egyptian slave named hagar sarai said to abram since the lord has prevented me from bearing children go to my slave perhaps through her i can build a family and abram agreed to what sarai said g so abram s wife sarai took hagar her egyptian slave and gave her to her husband abram as a wife for him this happened after abram had lived in the land of canaan ten years he slept with h hagar and she became pregnant when she saw that she was pregnant her mistress became contemptible to her then sarai said to abram you are responsible for my suffering i i put my slave in your arms j and when she saw that she was pregnant i became contemptible to her may the lord judge between me and you abram replied to sarai here your slave is in your hands do whatever you want with her then sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her the angel of the lord found her by a spring in the wilderness the spring on the way to shur he said hagar slave of sarai where have you come from and where are you going she replied i m running away from my

the lord who spoke to her you are el-roi b for she said in this place have i actually seen the one who sees me c that is why the well is called beer- lahai- roi d it is between kadesh and bered so hagar gave birth to abram s son and abram named his son whom hagar bore ishmael abram was eighty-six years old when hagar bore ishmael to him covenant circumcision when abram was ninety-nine years old the lord appeared to him saying i am god almighty live e in my presence and be blameless i will set up my covenant between me and you and i will multiply you greatly then abram fell facedown and god spoke with him as for me here is my covenant with you you will become the father of many nations your name will no longer be abram f your name will be abraham g for i will make you the father of many nations i will make you extremely fruitful and will make nations and kings come from you i will confirm my covenant that is between me and you and your future offspring throughout their generations it is a permanent covenant to be your god and the god of your offspring after you and to you and your future offspring i will give the land where you are residing all the land of canaan as a permanent possession and i will be their god god also said to abraham as for you you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep my covenant this is my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you which you are to keep every one of your males must be circumcised you must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you h throughout your generations every male among you is to be circumcised at eight days old every male born in your household or purchased from any foreigner and not your offspring whether born in your household or purchased he must be circumcised my covenant will be marked in your flesh as a permanent covenant if any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that man will be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant god said to abraham as for your wife sarai do not call her sarai for sarah i will be her name i will bless her indeed i will give you a son by her i will bless her and she will produce nations kings of peoples will come from her abraham fell facedown then he laughed and said to himself can a child be born to a hundred-year-old man can sarah a ninetyyear- old woman give birth so abraham said to god if only ishmael were acceptable j to you but god said no your wife sarah will bear you a son and you will name him isaac k i will confirm my covenant with him as a permanent covenant for his future offspring as for ishmael i have heard you i will certainly bless him i will make him fruitful and will multiply him greatly he will father twelve tribal leaders and i will make him into a great nation but i will confirm my covenant with isaac whom sarah will bear to you at this time next year when he finished talking with him god withdrew l from abraham so abraham took his son ishmael and those born in his household or purchased every male among the members of abraham s household and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day just as god had said to him abraham was ninety-nine years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised and his son ishmael was thirteen years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised on that same day abraham and his son ishmael were circumcised and all the men of his household whether born in his household or purchased from a foreigner were circumcised with him abraham s three visitors

way later you can continue on yes they replied do as you have said so abraham hurried into the tent and said to sarah quick knead three measures b of fine flour and make bread c abraham ran to the

sodom the men got up from there and looked out over sodom and abraham was walking with them to see them off then the lord said should i hide what i am about to do from abraham abraham is to become a great and powerful nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him for i have chosen h him so that he will command his children and his house after him to keep the way of the lord by doing what is right and just this is how the lord will fulfill to abraham what he promised him then the lord said the outcry against sodom and gomorrah is immense and their sin is extremely serious i will go down to see if what they have done justifies the cry that has come up to me if not i will find out the men turned from there and went toward sodom while abraham remained standing before the lord i abraham stepped forward and said will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked what if there are fifty righteous people in the city will you really sweep it away instead of sparing the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who are in it you could not possibly do such a thing to kill the righteous with the wicked treating the righteous and the wicked alike you could not possibly do that won t the judge of the whole earth do what is just the lord said if i find fifty righteous people in the city of sodom i will spare the whole place for their sake then abraham answered since i have ventured to speak to my lord even though i am dust and ashes suppose the fifty righteous lack five will you destroy the whole city for lack of five he replied i will not destroy it if i find forty- five there then he spoke to him again suppose forty are found there he answered i will not do it on account of forty then he said let my lord not be angry and i will speak further suppose thirty are found there he answered i will not do it if i find thirty there then he said since i have ventured to speak to my lord suppose twenty are found there he replied i will not destroy it on account of twenty then he said let my lord not be angry and i will speak one more time suppose ten are found there he answered i will not destroy it on account of ten when the lord had finished

your servant s house wash your feet and spend the night then you can get up early and go on your way no they said we would rather spend the night in the square but he urged them so strongly that they followed him and went into his house he prepared a feast and baked unleavened bread for them and they ate before they went to bed the men of the city of sodom both young and old the whole population surrounded the house they called out to lot and said where are the men who came to you tonight send them out to us so we can have sex with them lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him he said don t do this evil my brothers look i ve got two daughters who haven t been intimate with a man i ll bring them out to you and you can do whatever you want a to them however don t do anything to these men because they have come under the protection of my roof get out of the way they said adding this one came here as an alien but he s acting like a judge now we ll do more harm

anyone else in the city who belongs to you get them out of this place for we are about to destroy this place because the outcry against its people is so great before the lord that the lord has sent us

thought he was joking at daybreak the angels urged lot on get up take your wife and your two daughters who are here or you will be swept away in the punishment e of the city but he hesitated because

one of them f said run for your lives don t look back and don t stop anywhere on the plain run to the mountains or you will be swept away but lot said to them no my lords g please your servant has

to flee to it is a small place please let me run to it it s only a small place isn t it so that i can survive and he said to him all right h i ll grant your request i about this matter too and will

from there abraham traveled to the region of the negev and settled between kadesh and shur while he was staying in gerar abraham said about his wife sarah she is my sister so king abimelech of gerar had sarah brought to him but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him you are about to die because of the woman you have taken for she is a married woman c now abimelech had not approached her so he said lord would you destroy a nation even though it is innocent didn t he himself say to me she is my sister and she herself said he is my brother i did this with a clear conscience d and clean e hands then god said to him in the dream yes i know that you did this with a clear conscience f i have also kept you from sinning against me therefore i have not let you touch her now return the man s wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live but if you do not return her know that you will certainly die you and all who are yours early in the morning abimelech got up called all his servants together and personally g told them all these things and the men were terrified then abimelech called abraham in and said to him what have you done to us how did i sin against you that you have brought such enormous guilt on me and on my kingdom you have done things to me that should never be done abimelech also asked abraham what made you do this abraham replied i thought there is absolutely no fear of god in this place they will kill me because of my wife besides she really is my sister the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife so when god had me wander from my father s house i said to her show your loyalty to me wherever we go and say about me he s my brother then abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves gave them to abraham and returned his wife sarah to him abimelech said look my land is before you settle wherever you want h and he said to sarah look i am giving your brother one thousand pieces of silver it is a verification of your honor i to all who are with you you are fully vindicated then abraham prayed to god and god healed abimelech his wife and his female slaves so that they could bear children for the lord had completely closed all the wombs in abimelech s household on account of sarah abraham s wife the birth of isaac the lord came to sarah as he had said and the lord did for sarah what he had promised sarah became pregnant and bore a son to abraham in his old age at the appointed time god had told him abraham named his son who was born to him the one sarah bore to him isaac when his son isaac was eight days old abraham circumcised him as god had commanded him abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born to him sarah said god has made me laugh and everyone who hears will laugh with me j she also said who would have told abraham that sarah would nurse children yet i have borne a son for him k in his old age hagar and ishmael

be a coheir with my son isaac this was very distressing to a abraham because of his son but god said to abraham do not be distressed b about the boy and about your slave whatever sarah says to you listen to her because your offspring will be traced through isaac and i will also make a nation of the slave s son because he is your offspring early in the morning abraham got up took bread and a waterskin put them on hagar s shoulders and sent her and the boy away she left and wandered in the wilderness of beer- sheba when the water in the skin was gone she left the boy under one of the bushes and went and sat at a distance about a bowshot away for she said i can t bear to watch the boy die while she sat at a distance she c wept loudly god heard the boy crying and the d angel of god called to hagar from heaven and said to her what s wrong hagar don t be afraid for god has heard the boy crying from the place where he is get up help the boy up and grasp his hand for i will make him a great nation then god opened her eyes and she saw a well so she went and filled the waterskin and gave the boy a drink god was with the boy and he grew he settled in the wilderness and became an archer he settled in the wilderness of paran and his mother got a wife for him from the land of egypt abraham s covenant with abimelech at that time abimelech accompanied by phicol the commander of his army said to abraham god is with you in everything you do swear to me by god here and now that you will not break an agreement with me or with my children and descendants as i have been loyal to you so you will be loyal to me and to the country where you are a resident alien and abraham said i swear it but abraham complained to abimelech because of the well that abimelech s servants had seized abimelech replied i don t know who did this thing you didn t report anything to me so i hadn t heard about it until today abraham took flocks and herds and gave them to abimelech and the two of them made a covenant abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock and abimelech said to abraham why have you separated these seven ewe lambs he replied you are to accept the seven ewe lambs from me so that this act e will serve as my witness that i dug this well therefore that place was called beer- sheba f because it was there that the two of them swore an oath after they had made a covenant at beer- sheba abimelech and phicol the commander of his army left and returned to the land of the philistines abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beersheba and there he called on the name of the lord the everlasting god and abraham lived as an alien in the land of the philistines for many days the sacrifice of isaac after these things god tested abraham and said to him abraham here i am he answered take your son he said your only son isaac whom you love go to the land of moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains i will tell you about so abraham got up early in the morning saddled his donkey and took with him two of his young men and his son isaac he split wood for a burnt offering and set out to go to the place god had told him about on the third day abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance then abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey the boy and i will go over there to worship then we ll come back to you abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son isaac in his hand he took the fire and the knife and the two of them walked on together then isaac spoke to his father abraham and said my father and he replied here i am my son isaac said the fire and the wood are here but where is the lamb for the burnt offering abraham answered god himself will provide g the lamb for the burnt offering my son then the two of them walked on together when they arrived at the place that god had told him about abraham built the altar a lit was very bad in the eyes of b lit let it not be bad in your eyes c lxx reads the boy d or an e lit that it f well of the oath or seven wells g lit see genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm there and arranged the wood he bound his son isaac a and placed him on the altar on

lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your only son from me abraham looked up and saw a ram b caught in the thicket by its horns so abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son and abraham named that place the lord will provide c so today it is said it will be provided d on the lord s mountain then the angel of the lord called to abraham a second time from heaven and said by myself i have sworn this is the lord s declaration because you have done this thing and have not withheld your only son i will indeed bless you and make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sand on the seashore your offspring will possess the city gates of their enemies and all the nations of the earth will be blessed e by your offspring because you have obeyed my command abraham went back to his young men and they got up and went together to beer- sheba and abraham settled in beer- sheba rebekah s family now after these things abraham was told milcah also has borne sons to your brother nahor uz his firstborn his brother buz kemuel the father of aram chesed hazo pildash

prince of god h among us bury your dead in our finest burial place i none of us will withhold from you his burial place for burying your dead then abraham rose and bowed down to the hethites the people of the land he said to them if you are willing for me to bury my dead listen to me and ask ephron son of zohar on my behalf to give me the cave of machpelah that belongs to him it is at the end of his field let him give it to me in your presence for the full price as burial property ephron was sitting among the hethites so in the hearing j of all the hethites who came to the gate of his city ephron the hethite answered abraham no my lord listen to me i give you the field and i give you the cave that is in it i give it to you in the sight k of my people bury your dead abraham bowed down to the people of the land and said to ephron in the hearing of the people of the land listen to me if you please let me pay the price of the field accept it from me and let me bury my dead there ephron answered abraham and said to him my lord listen to me land worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that between you and me bury your dead abraham agreed with ephron and abraham weighed out to ephron the silver that he had agreed to in the hearing of the hethites four hundred standard shekels l of silver so ephron s field at machpelah near mamre the field with its cave and all the trees anywhere within the boundaries of the field became abraham s possession in the sight of all the hethites who came to the gate of his city after this abraham buried his wife sarah in the cave of the

drink my lord she quickly lowered her jug to her hand and gave him a drink when she had finished giving him a drink she said i ll also draw water for your camels until they have had enough to drink a she quickly emptied her jug into the trough and hurried to the well again to draw water she drew water for all his camels while the man silently watched her to see whether or not the lord had made his journey a success as the camels finished drinking the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel and for her wrists two bracelets weighing ten shekels of gold whose daughter are you he asked please tell me is there room in your father s house for us to spend the night she answered him i am the daughter of bethuel son of milcah whom she bore to nahor she also said to him we have plenty of straw

laban ran out to the man at the spring as soon as he had seen the ring and the bracelets on his sister s wrists and when he had heard his sister rebekah s words the man said this to me he went to the man he was standing there by the camels at the spring laban said come you who are blessed by the lord why are you standing out here i have prepared the house and a place for the camels so the man came to the house and the camels were unloaded straw and feed were given to the camels and water was brought to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him a meal was set before him but he said i will not eat until i have said what i have to say so laban said please speak i am abraham s servant he said the lord has greatly blessed my master and he has become rich he has given him flocks and herds

lord on behalf of his wife because she was childless the lord was receptive to his prayer and his wife rebekah conceived but the children inside her struggled with each other and she said why is this happening to me j so she went to inquire of the lord and the lord said to her two nations are in your womb two peoples will come from you and be separated one people will be stronger than the other and the older will serve the younger when her time came to give birth there were indeed twins in her womb the first one came out red-looking k covered with hair l like a fur coat and they named him esau after this his brother came out grasping esau s heel with his hand so he was named jacob m isaac was sixty years old when they were born esau sells his birthright when the boys grew up esau became an expert hunter an outdoorsman n but jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home o isaac loved esau because he had a taste for wild game but rebekah loved jacob once when jacob was cooking a stew esau came in from the field exhausted he said to jacob let me eat some of that red stuff because i m exhausted that is why he was also named edom p jacob replied first sell me your birthright look said esau i m about to die so what good is a birthright to me jacob said swear to me first so he swore to jacob and sold his birthright to him then jacob gave bread and lentil stew to esau he ate drank got up and went away so esau despised his birthright the promise reaffirmed to isaac there was another famine in the land in addition to the one that had occurred in abraham s time and isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines at gerar the lord appeared to him and said do not go down to egypt live in the land that i tell you about stay in this land as an alien and i will be with you

abimelech king of the philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see a isaac caressing his wife rebekah abimelech sent for isaac and said so she is really your wife how could you say she is my sister isaac answered him because i thought i might die on account of her then abimelech said what is this you ve done to us one of the people could easily have slept with your wife and you would have brought guilt on us so abimelech warned all the people whoever harms this man or his wife will certainly be put to death conflicts over wells isaac sowed seed in that land and in that year he reaped b a hundred times what was sown the lord blessed him and the man became rich and kept getting richer until he was very wealthy he had flocks of sheep herds of cattle and many slaves and the philistines were envious of him philistines stopped up all the wells that his father s servants had dug in the days of his father abraham filling them with dirt and abimelech said to isaac leave us for you are much too powerful for us c so isaac left there camped in the gerar valley and lived there isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father abraham and that the philistines had stopped up after abraham died he gave them the same names his father had given them then isaac s servants dug in the valley and found a well of spring d water there but the herdsmen of gerar quarreled with isaac s herdsmen and said the water is ours so he named the well esek e because they argued with him then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also so he named it sitnah f he moved from there and dug another and they did not quarrel over it he named it rehoboth g and said for now the lord has made space for us and we will be fruitful in the land the lord appears to isaac from there he went up to beer- sheba and the lord appeared to him that night and said i am the god of your father abraham do not be afraid for i am with you i will bless you and multiply your offspring because of my servant abraham so he built an altar there called on the name of the lord and pitched his tent there isaac s servants also dug a well there covenant with abimelech now abimelech came to him from gerar with ahuzzath his adviser and phicol the commander of his army isaac said to them why have you come to me you hated me and sent me away from you they replied we have clearly seen how the lord has been with you we think there should be an oath between two parties between us and you let us make a covenant with you you will not harm us just as we have not harmed you but have done only what was good to you sending you away in peace you are now blessed by the lord so he prepared a banquet for them and they ate and drank they got up early in the morning and swore an oath to each other h isaac sent them on their way and they left him in peace on that same day isaac s servants came to tell him about the well they had dug saying to him we have

listening to what isaac said to his son esau so while esau went to the field to hunt some game to bring in rebekah said to her son jacob listen i heard your father talking with your brother esau he said bring me game and make a delicious meal for me to eat so that i can bless you in the lord s presence before i die now my son listen to me and do what i tell you go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats and i will make them into a delicious meal for your father the kind he loves then take it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies jacob answered rebekah his mother look my brother esau is a hairy man but i am a man with smooth skin suppose my father touches me then i will be revealed to him as a deceiver and bring a curse rather than a blessing on myself his mother said to him your curse be on me my son just obey me and go get them for me so he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother and his mother made the delicious food his father loved then rebekah took the best clothes of her older son esau which were in the house and had her younger son jacob wear them she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his neck then she handed the delicious food and the bread she had made to her son jacob when he came to his father he said my father and he answered here i am who are you my son jacob replied to his father i am esau your firstborn i have done as you told me please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may bless me but isaac said to his son how did you ever find it so quickly my son he replied because the lord your god made it happen for me then isaac said to jacob please come closer so i can touch you my son are you really my son esau or not so jacob came closer to his father isaac when he touched him he said the voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of esau he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like those of his brother esau so he blessed him again he asked are you really my son esau and he replied i am then he said bring it closer to me and let me eat some of my son s game so that i can bless you jacob brought it closer to him and he ate he brought him wine and he drank then his father isaac said to him please come closer and kiss me my son so he came closer and kissed him when isaac smelled a his clothes he blessed him and said ah the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the lord has blessed may god give to you from the dew of the sky and from the richness of the land an abundance of grain and new wine may peoples serve you and nations bow in worship to you be master over your relatives may your mother s sons bow in worship to you those who curse you will be cursed and those who bless you will be blessed as soon as isaac had finished blessing jacob and jacob had left the presence of his father isaac his brother esau arrived from his hunting he had also made some delicious food and brought it to his father he said to his father let my father get up and eat some of his son s game so that you may bless me but his father isaac said to him who are you he answered i am esau your firstborn son isaac began to tremble uncontrollably who was it then he said who hunted game and brought it to me i ate it all before you came in and i blessed him indeed he will be blessed when esau heard his father s words he cried out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father bless me too my father but he replied your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing a lit smelled the smell of genesis csb_pew_bible indb pm so he said isn t he rightly named jacob a for he has cheated me twice now he took my birthright and look now he has taken my blessing then he asked haven t you saved a blessing for me but isaac answered esau look i have made him a master over you have given him all of his relatives as his servants and have sustained him with grain and new wine what then can i do for you my son esau said to his father do you have only one blessing my father bless me too my father and esau wept loudly b his father isaac answered him look your dwelling place will be away from the richness of the land away from the dew of the sky above you will live by your sword and you will serve your brother but when you rebel c you will break his yoke from your neck esau s anger esau held a grudge against jacob because of the blessing his father had given him and esau determined in his heart the days of mourning for my father are approaching then i will kill my brother jacob when the words of her older son esau were reported to rebekah she summoned her younger son jacob and said to him listen your brother esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you so now my son listen to me flee at once to my brother laban in haran and stay with him for a few days until your brother s anger subsides until your brother s rage turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him then i will send for you and bring you back from there why should i lose you both in one day so rebekah said to isaac i m sick of my life because of these hethite girls if jacob marries someone from around here d like these hethite girls what good is my life jacob s departure so isaac summoned jacob blessed him and commanded him do not marry a canaanite girl go at once to paddan-aram to the house of bethuel your mother s father marry one of the daughters of laban your mother s brother may god almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you become an assembly of peoples may god give you and your offspring the blessing of abraham so that you may possess the land where you live as a foreigner the land god gave to abraham so isaac sent jacob to paddan-aram to laban son of bethuel the aramean the brother of rebekah the mother of jacob and esau esau noticed that isaac blessed jacob and sent him to paddan-aram to get a wife there when he blessed him isaac commanded jacob do not marry a canaanite girl and jacob listened to his father and mother and went to paddan-aram esau realized that his father isaac disapproved of the canaanite women so esau went to ishmael and married in addition to his other wives mahalath daughter of ishmael abraham s son she was the sister of nebaioth jacob at bethel jacob left beer- sheba and went toward haran he reached a certain place and spent the night there because the sun had set he took one of the stones from the place put it there at his head and lay down in that place and he dreamed a stairway was set on the ground with its top reaching the sky and god s angels were going up and down on it the lord was standing there beside him e saying i am the lord the god of your father abraham and the god of isaac i will give you and your offspring the land on which you are lying your offspring will be like the dust of the earth and you will spread out toward the west the east the north and the south all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring look i am with you and will watch over you wherever you go i will bring you back to this land for i will not leave you until i have done what i have promised you when jacob awoke from his sleep he said surely the lord is in this place and i did not know it he was afraid and said what an awesome place this is this is none other than the house of god this is the gate of heaven early in the morning jacob took the stone that was near his head and set it up as a marker he poured oil on top of it and named the place bethel f though previously the city was named luz then jacob made a vow if god a he grasps the heel b lit esau lifted up his voice and wept c hb obscure d lit someone like these daughters of the land e or there above it f house of god

then the lord will be my god this stone that i have set up as a marker will be god s house and i will give to you a tenth of all that you give me jacob meets rachel jacob resumed his journey a and went to the eastern country b he looked and saw a well in a field three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it because the sheep were watered from this well but a large stone covered the opening of the well the shepherds would roll the stone from the opening of the well and water the sheep when all the flocks c were gathered there then they would return the stone to its place over the well s opening jacob asked the men at the well my brothers where are you from we re from haran they answered do you know laban grandson of nahor jacob asked them they answered we know him is he well jacob asked yes they said and here is his daughter rachel coming with his sheep then jacob said look it is still broad daylight it s not time for the animals to be gathered water the flock then go out and let them graze but they replied we can t until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone is rolled from the well s opening then we will water the sheep while he was still speaking with them rachel came with her father s sheep for she was a shepherdess as soon as jacob saw his uncle laban s daughter rachel with his sheep d he went up and rolled the stone from the opening and watered his uncle laban s sheep then jacob kissed rachel and wept loudly e he told rachel that he was her father s relative rebekah s son she ran and told her father jacob deceived when laban heard the news about his sister s son jacob he ran to meet him hugged him and kissed him then he took him to his house and jacob told him all that had happened laban said to him yes you are my own flesh and blood f after jacob had stayed with him a month laban said to him just because you re my relative should you work for me for nothing tell me what your wages should be now laban had two daughters the older was named leah and the younger was named rachel leah had tender eyes but rachel was shapely and beautiful jacob loved rachel so he answered laban i ll work for you seven years for your younger daughter rachel laban replied better that i give her to you than to some other man stay with me so jacob worked seven years for rachel and they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her then jacob said to laban since my time is complete give me my wife so i can sleep with g her so laban invited all the men of the place and sponsored a feast that evening laban took his daughter leah and gave her to jacob and he slept with her and laban gave his slave zilpah to his daughter leah as her slave when morning came there was leah so he said to laban what is this you have done to me wasn t it for rachel that i worked for you why have you deceived me laban answered it is not the custom in this place to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn complete this week of wedding celebration and we will also give you this younger one in return for working yet another seven years for me and jacob did just that he finished the week of celebration and laban gave him his daughter rachel as his wife and laban gave his slave bilhah to his daughter rachel as her slave jacob slept with rachel also and indeed he loved rachel more than leah and he worked for laban another seven years jacob s sons when the lord saw that leah was unloved he opened her womb but rachel was unable to conceive leah conceived gave birth to a son and named him reuben h for she said the lord

praise the lord therefore she named him judah c then leah stopped having children when rachel saw that she was not bearing jacob any children she envied her sister give me sons or i will die she said to jacob jacob became angry with rachel and said am i in god s place who has withheld offspring d from you then she said here is my maid bilhah go sleep with her and she ll bear children for me e so that through her i too can build a family so rachel gave her slave bilhah to jacob as a wife and he slept with her bilhah conceived and bore jacob a son rachel said god has vindicated me yes he has heard me and given me a son so she named him dan f rachel s slave bilhah conceived again and bore jacob a second son rachel said in my wrestlings with god g i have wrestled with my sister and won and she named him naphtali h when leah saw that she had stopped having children she took her slave zilpah and gave her to jacob as a wife leah s slave zilpah bore jacob a son then leah said what good

and found some mandrakes in the field when he brought them to his mother leah rachel asked please give me some of your son s mandrakes but leah replied to her isn t it enough that you have taken my husband now you also want to take my son s mandrakes well then rachel said he can sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son s mandrakes when jacob came in from the field that evening leah went out to meet him and said you must come with me for i have hired you with my son s mandrakes so jacob slept with her that night god listened to leah and she conceived and bore jacob a fifth son leah said god has rewarded me for giving my slave to my husband and she named him issachar l then leah conceived again and bore jacob a sixth son god has given me a good gift leah said this time my husband will honor me because i have borne six sons for him and she named him zebulun m later leah bore a daughter and named her dinah then god remembered rachel he listened to her and opened her womb she conceived and bore a son and she said god has taken away my disgrace she named him joseph n and said may the lord add another son to me jacob s flocks multiply after rachel gave birth to joseph jacob said to laban send me on my way so that i can return to my homeland give me my wives and my children that i have worked for and let me go you know how hard i have worked for you but laban said to him if i have found favor with you stay i have learned by divination that the lord has blessed me because of you then laban said name your wages and i will pay them so jacob said to him you know how i have served you and how your herds have fared with me for you had very little before i came but now your wealth has increased the lord has blessed you because of me and now when will i also do something for my own family laban asked what should i give you and jacob said you don t need to give me anything if you do this one thing for me i will continue to shepherd and keep your flock let me go through all your sheep today and remove every sheep that is speckled or spotted every dark-colored sheep among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the female goats such will be my wages in

the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats every one that had any white on it and every dark-colored one among the lambs and he placed his sons in charge of them he put a three-day journey between himself and jacob jacob meanwhile was shepherding the rest of laban s flock jacob then took branches of fresh poplar almond and plane wood and peeled the bark exposing white stripes on the branches he set the peeled branches in the troughs in front of the sheep in the water channels where the sheep came to drink and the sheep bred when they came to drink the flocks bred in front of the branches and bore streaked speckled and spotted young jacob separated the lambs and made the flocks face the streaked sheep and the completely dark sheep in laban s flocks then he set his own stock apart and didn t put them with laban s sheep whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding jacob placed the branches in the troughs in full view of the flocks and they would breed in front of the branches as for the weaklings of the flocks he did not put out the branches so it turned out that the weak sheep belonged to laban and the stronger ones to jacob and the man became very rich a he had many flocks female and male slaves and camels and donkeys jacob separates from laban now jacob heard what laban s sons were saying jacob has taken all that was our father s and has built this wealth from what belonged to our father and jacob saw from laban s face that his attitude toward him was not the same as before the lord said to him go back to the land of your fathers and to your family and i will be with you jacob had rachel and leah called to the field where his flocks were he said to them i can see from your father s face that his attitude toward me is not the same as before but the god of my father has been with me you know that with all my strength i have served your father and that he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times but god has not let him harm me if he said the spotted sheep will be your wages then all the sheep were born spotted if he said the streaked sheep will be your wages then all the sheep were born streaked god has taken away your father s herds and given them to me when the flocks were breeding i saw in a dream that the streaked spotted and speckled males were mating with the females in that dream the angel of god said to me jacob and i said here i am and he said look up and see all the males that are mating with the flocks are streaked spotted and speckled for i have seen all that laban has been doing to you i am the god of bethel where you poured oil on the stone marker and made a solemn vow to me get up leave this land and return to your native land then rachel and leah answered him do we have any portion or inheritance in our father s family are we not regarded by him as outsiders for he has sold us and has certainly spent our purchase price in fact all the wealth that god has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children so do whatever god has said to you so jacob got up and put his children and wives on the camels he took all the livestock and possessions he had acquired in paddan-aram and he drove his herds to go to the land of canaan to his father isaac when laban had gone to shear his sheep rachel stole her father s household idols and jacob deceived b laban the aramean not telling him that he was fleeing he fled with all his possessions crossed the euphrates and headed for c the hill country of gilead laban overtakes jacob on the third day laban was told that jacob had fled so he took his relatives with him pursued jacob for seven days and overtook him in the hill country of gilead but god came to laban the aramean in a dream at night watch yourself god warned him don t say anything to jacob either good or bad when laban overtook jacob jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country and laban and his relatives also pitched their tents in the hill country of gilead laban said to jacob what have you done you have deceived me and taken my daughters away like prisoners a lit the man spread out very much very much b lit and he stole the heart of c lit and set his face to genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm of war why did you secretly flee from me deceive me and not tell me i would have sent you away with joy and singing with tambourines and lyres but you didn t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters you have acted foolishly i could do you great harm but last night the god of your father said to me watch yourself don t say anything to jacob either good or bad now you have gone off because you long for your father s family but why have you stolen my gods jacob answered i was afraid for i thought you would take your daughters from me by force if you find your gods with anyone here he will not live before our relatives point out anything that is yours and take it jacob did not know that rachel had stolen the idols so laban went into jacob s tent leah s tent and the tents of the two concubines a but he found nothing when he left leah s tent he went into rachel s tent now rachel had taken laban s household idols put them in the saddlebag of the camel and sat on them laban searched the whole tent but found nothing she said to her father don t be angry my lord that i cannot stand up in your presence i am having my period so laban searched but could not find the household idols jacob s covenant with laban then jacob became incensed and brought charges against laban what is my crime he said to laban what is my sin that you have pursued me you ve searched all my possessions have you found anything of yours b put it here before my relatives and yours and let them decide between the two of us i ve been with you these twenty years your ewes and female goats have not miscarried and i have not eaten the rams from your flock i did not bring you any of the flock torn by wild beasts i myself bore the loss you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or by night there i was the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night and sleep fled from my eyes for twenty years in your household i served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks and you have changed my wages ten times if the god of my father the god of abraham the fear of isaac had not been with me certainly now you would have sent me off empty-handed but god has seen my affliction and my hard work c and he issued his verdict last night then laban answered jacob the daughters are my daughters the sons my sons and the flocks my flocks everything you see is mine but what can i do today for these daughters of mine or for the children they have borne come now let s make a covenant you and i let it be a witness between the two of us so jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a marker then jacob said to his relatives gather stones and they took stones and made a mound then ate there by the mound laban named the mound jegar-sahadutha but jacob named it galeed d then laban said this mound is a witness between you and me today therefore the place was called galeed and also mizpah e for he said may the lord watch between you and me when we are out of each other s sight if you mistreat my daughters or take other wives though no one is with us understand that god will be a witness between you and me laban also said to jacob look at this mound and the marker i have set up between you and me this mound is a witness and the marker is a witness that i will not pass beyond this mound to you and you will not pass beyond this mound and this marker to do me harm the god of abraham and the gods of nahor the gods of their father f will judge between us and jacob swore by the fear of his father isaac then jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal so they ate a meal and spent the night on the mountain laban got up early in the morning kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them then laban left to return home preparing to meet esau jacob went on his way and god s angels met him when he saw them jacob said this is god s camp so he called that place mahanaim g jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother esau in the land of seir the territory of edom he commanded them you are to say to my lord esau this is what your servant

and female slaves i have sent this message to inform my lord in order to seek your favor when the messengers returned to jacob they said we went to your brother esau he is coming to meet you and he has four hundred men with him jacob was greatly afraid and distressed he divided the people with him into two camps along with the flocks herds and camels he thought if esau comes to one camp and attacks it the remaining one can escape then jacob said god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord who said to me go back to your land and to your family and i will cause you to prosper i am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant indeed i crossed over the jordan with my staff and now i have become two camps please rescue me from my brother esau for i am afraid of him otherwise he may come and attack me the mothers and their children you have said i will cause you to prosper and i will make your offspring like the sand of the sea too numerous to be counted he spent the night there and took part of what he had brought with him as a gift for his brother esau two hundred female goats twenty male goats two hundred ewes twenty rams thirty milk camels with their young forty cows ten bulls twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys he entrusted them to his slaves as separate herds and said to them go on ahead of me and leave some distance between the herds and he told the first one when my brother esau meets you and asks who do you belong to where are you going and whose animals are these ahead of you then tell him they belong to your servant jacob they are a gift sent to my lord esau and look he is behind us he also told the second one the third and everyone who was walking behind the animals say the same thing to esau when you find him you are also to say look your servant jacob is right behind us for he thought i want to appease esau with the gift that is going ahead of me after that i can face him and perhaps he will forgive me so the gift was sent on ahead of him while he remained in the camp that night during the night jacob got up and took his two wives his two slave women and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of jabbok he took them and sent them across the stream along with all his possessions jacob wrestles with god jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until daybreak when the man saw that he could not defeat him he struck jacob s hip socket as they wrestled and dislocated his hip then he said to jacob let me go for it is daybreak but jacob said i will not let you go unless you bless me what is your name the man asked jacob he replied your name will no longer be jacob he said it will be israel a because you have struggled with god and with men and have prevailed then jacob asked him please tell me your name but he answered why do you ask my name and he blessed him there jacob then named the place peniel b for i have seen god face to face he said yet my life has been spared the sun shone on him as he passed by penuel c limping because of his hip that is why still today the israelites don t eat the thigh muscle that is at the hip socket because he struck jacob s hip socket at the thigh muscle d jacob meets esau now jacob looked up and saw esau coming toward him with four hundred men so he divided the children among leah rachel and the two slave women he put the slaves and their children first leah and her children next and rachel and joseph last he himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times until he approached his brother but esau ran to meet him hugged him threw his arms around him and kissed him then they wept when esau looked up and saw the women and children he asked who are these with you he answered the children god has graciously given your servant then the slaves a in hb the name israel sounds like he struggled with god b face of god c variant of peniel d or tendon genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm and their children approached him and bowed down leah and her children also approached and bowed down and then joseph and rachel approached and bowed down so esau said what do you mean by this whole procession a i met to find favor with you my lord he answered i have enough my brother esau replied keep what you have but jacob said no please if i have found favor with you take this gift from me for indeed i have seen your face and it is like seeing god s face since you have accepted me please take my present that was brought to you because god has been gracious to me and i have everything i need so jacob urged him until he accepted then esau said let s move on and i ll go ahead of you jacob replied my lord knows that the children are weak and i have nursing flocks and herds if they are driven hard for one day the whole herd will die let my lord go ahead of his servant i will continue on slowly at a pace suited to the livestock and the children until i come to my lord at seir esau said let me leave some of my people with you but he replied why do that please indulge me b my lord that day esau started on his way back to seir but jacob went to succoth he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock that is why the place was called succoth c after jacob came from paddan-aram he arrived safely at shechem in the land of canaan and camped in front of the city he purchased a section of the field where he had pitched his tent from the sons of hamor shechem s father for a hundred pieces of silver d and he set up an altar there and called it god the god of israel e dinah defiled leah s daughter dinah whom leah bore to jacob went out to see some of the young women of the area when shechem son of hamor the hivite who was the region s chieftain saw her he took her and raped her he became infatuated with jacob s daughter dinah he loved the young girl and spoke tenderly to her f get me this girl as a wife he told his father jacob heard that shechem had defiled his daughter dinah but since his sons were with his livestock in the field he remained silent until they returned meanwhile shechem s father hamor came to speak with jacob jacob s sons returned from the field when they heard about the incident and were deeply grieved and very angry for shechem had committed an outrage against israel by raping jacob s daughter and such a thing should not be done hamor said to jacob s sons my son shechem has his heart set on your g daughter please give her to him as a wife intermarry with us give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves live with us the land is before you settle here move about and acquire property in it then shechem said to dinah s father and brothers grant me this favor h and i ll give you whatever you say demand of me a high compensation i and gift i ll give you whatever you ask me just give the girl to be my wife but jacob s sons answered shechem and his father hamor deceitfully because he had defiled their sister dinah we cannot do this thing they said to them giving our sister to an uncircumcised man is a disgrace to us we will agree with you only on this condition if all your males are circumcised as we are then we will give you our daughters take your daughters for ourselves live with you and become one people but if you will not listen to us and be circumcised then we will take our daughter and go their words seemed good to hamor and his son shechem the young man did not delay doing this because he was delighted with jacob s daughter now he was the most important in all his father s family so hamor and his son shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city these men are peaceful toward us they said let them live in our land and move about in it for indeed the region is large enough for them let us take their daughters as our wives and give our daughters to them but the men will agree to live with us and be one people only on this condition if all our men are circumcised

were circumcised on the third day when they were still in pain two of jacob s sons simeon and levi dinah s brothers took their swords went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male they killed hamor and his son shechem with their swords took dinah from shechem s house and went away jacob s sons came to the slaughter and plundered the city because their sister had been defiled they took their flocks herds donkeys and whatever was in the city and in the field they captured all their possessions dependents and wives and plundered everything in the houses then jacob said to simeon and levi you have brought trouble on me making me odious to the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and the perizzites we are few in number if they unite against me and attack me i and my household will be destroyed but they answered should he treat our sister like a prostitute return to bethel god said to jacob get up go to bethel and settle there build an altar there to the god who appeared to you when you fled from your brother esau so jacob said to his family and all who were with him get rid of the foreign gods that are among you purify yourselves and change your clothes we must get up and go to bethel i will build an altar there to the god who answered me in my day of distress he has been with me everywhere i have gone then they gave jacob all their foreign gods and their earrings and jacob hid them under the oak near shechem when they set out a terror from god came over the cities around them and they did not pursue jacob s sons so jacob and all who were with him came to luz that is bethel in the land of canaan jacob built an altar there and called the place el-bethel a because it was there that god had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother deborah the one who had nursed and raised rebekah b died and was buried under the oak south of bethel so jacob named it allon- bacuth c god appeared to jacob again after he returned from paddan-aram and he blessed him god said to him your name is jacob you will no longer be named jacob but your name will be israel so he named him israel god also said to him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation indeed an assembly of nations will come from you and kings will descend from you d i will give to you the land that i gave to abraham and isaac and i will give the land to your future descendants then god withdrew e from him at the place where he had spoken to him jacob set up a marker at the place where he had spoken to him a stone marker he poured a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil jacob named the place where god had spoken with him bethel rachel s death they set out from bethel when they were still some distance from ephrath rachel began to give birth and her labor was difficult during her difficult labor the midwife said to her don t be afraid for you have another son with her last breath for she was dying she named him ben-oni f but his father called him benjamin g so rachel died and was buried on the way to ephrath that is bethlehem jacob set up a marker on her grave it is the marker at rachel s grave still today israel s sons israel set out again and pitched his tent beyond the tower of eder h while israel was living in that region reuben went in and slept with his father s concubine bilhah and israel heard about it jacob had twelve sons

years of age joseph tended sheep with his brothers the young man was working with the sons of bilhah and zilpah his father s wives and he brought a bad report about them to their father now israel loved joseph more than his other sons because joseph was a son born to him in his old age and he made a robe of many colors d for him when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers they hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him then joseph had a dream when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more he said to them listen to this dream i had there we were binding sheaves of grain in the field suddenly my sheaf stood up and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf are you really going to reign over us his brothers asked him are you really going to rule us so they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said then he had another dream and told it to his brothers look he said i had another dream and this time the sun moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me he told his father and brothers and his father rebuked him what kind of dream is this that you have had he said am i and your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the ground before you his brothers were jealous of him but his father kept the matter in mind joseph sold into slavery his brothers had gone to pasture their father s flocks at shechem israel said to joseph a lit horites for their chiefs b many hb mss sam syr read hadad c lit he esau d or robe with long sleeves see sm genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm your brothers you know are pasturing the flocks at shechem get ready i m sending you to them i m ready joseph replied then israel said to him go and see how your brothers and the flocks are doing and bring word back to me so he sent him from the hebron valley and he went to shechem a man found him there wandering in the field and asked him what are you looking for i m looking for my brothers joseph said can you tell me where they are pasturing their flocks they ve moved on from here the man said i heard them say let s go to dothan so joseph set out after his brothers and found them at dothan they saw him in the distance and before he had reached them they plotted to kill him they said to one another oh look here comes that dream expert a so now come on let s kill him and throw him into one of the pits b we can say that a vicious animal ate him then we ll see what becomes of his dreams when reuben heard this he tried to save him from them c he said let s not take his life reuben also said to them don t shed blood throw him into this pit in the wilderness but don t lay a hand on him intending to rescue him from them and return him to his father when joseph came to his brothers they stripped off joseph s robe the robe of many colors that he had on then they took him and threw him into the pit the pit was empty without water they sat down to eat a meal and when they looked up there was a caravan of ishmaelites coming from gilead their camels were carrying aromatic gum balsam and resin going down to egypt judah said to his brothers what do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood come on let s sell him to the ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him for he is our brother our own flesh and his brothers agreed when midianite traders passed by his brothers pulled joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the ishmaelites who took joseph to egypt when reuben returned to the pit and saw that joseph was not there he tore his clothes he went back to his brothers and said the boy is gone what am i going to do d so they took joseph s robe slaughtered a male goat and dipped the robe in its blood they sent the robe of many colors to their father and said we found this examine it is it your son s robe or not his father recognized it it is my son s robe he said a vicious animal has devoured him joseph has been torn to pieces then jacob tore his clothes put sackcloth around his waist and mourned for his son many days all his sons and daughters tried to comfort him but he refused to be comforted no he said i will go down to sheol to my son mourning and his father wept for him meanwhile the midianites sold joseph in egypt to potiphar an officer of pharaoh and the captain of the guards judah and tamar at that time judah left his brothers and settled near an adullamite named hirah there judah saw the daughter of a canaanite named shua he took her as a wife and slept with her she conceived and gave birth to a son and he named him er she conceived again gave birth to a son and named him onan she gave birth to another son and named him shelah it was at chezib that e f she gave birth to him judah got a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar now er judah s firstborn was evil in the lord s sight and the lord put him to death then judah said to onan sleep with your brother s wife perform your duty as her brother-in-law and produce offspring for your brother but onan knew that the offspring would not be his so whenever he slept with his brother s wife he released his semen on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother what he did was evil in the lord s sight so he put him to death also then judah said to his daughter-in-law tamar remain a widow in your father s house until my son shelah grows up for he thought he might die too like his brothers so tamar went to live in her father s house after a long time g judah s wife the daughter of shua died when judah had finished mourning he and his friend hirah the adullamite went up to timnah to his sheepshearers tamar was told your father-in-law is a lit comes the lord of

going up to timnah to shear his sheep so she took off her widow s clothes veiled her face covered herself and sat at the entrance to enaim a which is on the way to timnah for she saw that though shelah had grown up she had not been given to him as a wife when judah saw her he thought she was a prostitute for she had covered her face he went over to her and said come let me sleep with you for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law she said what will you give me for sleeping with me i will send you a young goat from my flock he replied but she said only if you leave something with me until you send it what should i give you he asked she answered your signet ring your cord and the staff in your hand so he gave them to her and slept with her and she became pregnant by him she got up and left then removed her veil and put her widow s clothes back on when judah sent the young goat by his friend the adullamite in order to get back the items he had left with the woman he could not find her he asked the men of the place where is the cult prostitute who was beside the road at enaim there has been no cult prostitute here they answered so the adullamite returned to judah saying i couldn t find her and besides the men of the place said there has been no cult prostitute here judah replied let her keep the items for herself otherwise we will become a laughingstock after all i did send this young goat but you couldn t find her about three months later judah was told your daughter-in-law tamar has been acting like a prostitute and now she is pregnant bring her out judah said and let her be burned to death as she was being brought out she sent her father-in-law this message i am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong and she added examine them whose signet ring cord and staff are these judah recognized them and said she is more in the right b than i since i did not give her to my son shelah and he did not know her intimately again when the time came for her to give birth there were twins in her womb as she was giving birth one of them put out his hand and the midwife took it and tied a scarlet thread around it announcing this one came out first but then he pulled his hand back out came his brother and she said what a breakout you have made for yourself so he was named perez c then his brother who had the scarlet thread tied to his hand came out and was named zerah d joseph in potiphar s house now joseph had been taken to egypt an egyptian named potiphar an officer of pharaoh and the captain of the guards bought him from the ishmaelites who had brought him there the lord was with joseph and he became a successful man serving e in the household of his egyptian master when his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made everything he did successful joseph found favor with his master and became his personal attendant potiphar also put him in charge of his household and placed all that he owned under his authority f from the time that he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned the lord blessed the egyptian s house because of joseph the lord s blessing was on all that he owned in his house and in his fields he left all that he owned under joseph s authority g he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate now joseph was well-built and handsome after some time h his master s wife looked longingly at joseph and said sleep with me but he refused look he said to his master s wife with me here my master does not concern himself with anything in his house and he has put all that he owns under my authority i no one in this house is greater than i am he has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife so how could i do this immense evil and how could i sin

leaving his garment in her hand he escaped and ran outside when she saw that he had left his garment with her and had run outside she called her household servants look she said to them my husband brought a hebrew man to make fools of us he came to me so he could sleep with me and i screamed as loud as i could when he heard me screaming for help b he left his garment beside me and ran outside she put joseph s garment beside her until his master came home then she told him the same story the hebrew slave you brought to us came to make a fool of me but when i screamed for help c he left his garment beside me and ran outside when his master heard the story his wife told him these are the things your slave did to me he was furious and had him thrown into prison where the king s prisoners were confined so joseph was there in prison joseph in prison but the lord was with joseph and extended kindness to him he granted him favor with the prison warden the warden put all the prisoners who were in the prison under joseph s authority d and he was responsible for everything that was done there the warden did not bother with anything under joseph s authority e because the lord was with him and the lord made everything that he did successful joseph interprets two prisoners dreams after this the king of egypt s cupbearer and baker offended their master the king of egypt pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guards in the prison where joseph was confined the captain of the guards assigned joseph to them as their personal attendant and they were in custody for some time f the king of egypt s cupbearer and baker who were confined in the prison each had a dream both had a dream on the same night and each dream had its own meaning when joseph came to them in the morning he saw that they looked distraught so he asked pharaoh s officers who were in custody with him in his master s house why do you look so sad today we had dreams they said to him but there is no one to interpret them then joseph said to them don t interpretations belong to god tell me your dreams so the chief cupbearer told his dream to joseph in my dream there was a vine in front of me on the vine were three branches as soon as it budded its blossoms came out and its clusters ripened into grapes pharaoh s cup was in my hand and i took the grapes squeezed them into pharaoh s cup and placed the cup in pharaoh s hand this is its interpretation joseph said to him the three branches are three days in just three days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position you will put pharaoh s cup in his hand the way you used to when you were his cupbearer but when all goes well for you remember that i was with you please show kindness to me by mentioning me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison for i was kidnapped from the land of the hebrews and even here i have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon g when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was positive he said to joseph i also had a dream three baskets of white bread were on my head in the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for pharaoh but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head this is its interpretation joseph replied the three baskets are three days in just three days pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and hang you on a tree h then the birds will eat the flesh from your body i on the third day which was pharaoh s birthday he gave a feast for all his servants he elevated j the chief cupbearer and the chief baker among his servants pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position as cupbearer and he placed the cup in pharaoh s hand but pharaoh

when seven healthy-looking well-fed cows came up from the nile and began to graze among the reeds after them seven other cows sickly and thin came up from the nile and stood beside those cows along the bank of the nile the sickly thin cows ate the healthy well-fed cows then pharaoh woke up he fell asleep and dreamed a second time seven heads of grain plump and good came up on one stalk after them seven heads of grain thin and scorched by the east wind sprouted up the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump full ones then pharaoh woke up and it was only a dream when morning came he was troubled so he summoned all the magicians of egypt and all its wise men pharaoh told them his dreams but no one could interpret them for him then the chief cupbearer said to pharaoh today i remember my faults pharaoh was angry with his servants and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guards he and i had dreams on the same night each dream had its own meaning now a young hebrew a slave of the captain of the guards was with us there we told him our dreams he interpreted our dreams for us and each had its own interpretation it turned out just the way he interpreted them to us i was restored to my position and the other man was hanged then pharaoh sent for joseph and they quickly brought him from the dungeon a he shaved changed his clothes and went to pharaoh pharaoh said to joseph i have had a dream and no one can interpret it but i have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it i am not able to joseph answered pharaoh it is god who will give pharaoh a favorable answer b so pharaoh said to joseph in my dream i was standing on the bank of the nile when seven well-fed healthy-looking cows came up from the nile and grazed among the reeds after them seven other cows weak very sickly and thin came up i ve never seen such sickly ones as these in all the land of egypt then the thin sickly cows ate the first seven well-fed cows when they had devoured them you could not tell that they had devoured them their appearance was as bad as it had been before then i woke up in my dream i also saw seven heads of grain full and good coming up on one stalk after them seven heads of grain withered thin and scorched by the east wind sprouted up the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good ones i told this to the magicians but no one can tell me what it means then joseph said to pharaoh pharaoh s dreams mean the same thing god has revealed to pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good cows are seven years and the seven good heads are seven years the dreams mean the same thing the seven thin sickly cows that came up after them are seven years and the seven worthless scorched heads of grain are seven years of famine it is just as i told pharaoh god has shown pharaoh what he is about to do seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of egypt after them seven years of famine will take place and all the abundance in the land of egypt will be forgotten the famine will devastate the land the abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows it for the famine will be very severe since the dream was given twice to pharaoh it means that the matter has been determined by god and he will carry it out soon so now let pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this let him appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the harvest of the land of egypt during the seven years of abundance let them gather all the excess food during these good years that are coming under pharaoh s authority store the grain in the cities so they may preserve it as food the food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine that will take place in the land of egypt then the country will not be wiped out by the famine joseph exalted the proposal pleased pharaoh and all his servants and he said to them can we find anyone like this a man who has god s spirit c in him so pharaoh said to joseph since a or pit or cistern b or god will answer pharaoh with peace of mind c or the spirit of the gods or a god s spirit genesis csb_pew_bible indb pm god has made all this known to you there is no one as discerning and wise as you are you will be over my house and all my people will obey your commands a only i as king b will be greater than you pharaoh also said to joseph see i am placing you over all the land of egypt pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on joseph s hand clothed him with fine linen garments and placed a gold chain around his neck he had joseph ride in his second chariot and servants called out before him make way c so he placed him over all the land of egypt pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh and no one will be able to raise his hand or foot in all the land of egypt without your permission pharaoh gave joseph the name zaphenath-paneah and gave him a wife asenath daughter of potiphera priest at on d and joseph went throughout e the land of egypt joseph s administration joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of pharaoh king of egypt joseph left pharaoh s presence and traveled throughout the land of egypt during the seven years of abundance the land produced outstanding harvests joseph gathered all the excess food in the land of egypt during the seven years and put it in the cities he put the food in every city from the fields around it so joseph stored up grain in such abundance like the sand of the sea that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure two sons were born to joseph before the years of famine arrived asenath daughter of potiphera priest at on bore them to him joseph named the firstborn manasseh f and said god has made me forget all my hardship and my whole family and the second son he named ephraim g and said god has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction then the seven years of abundance in the land of egypt came to an end and the seven years of famine began just as joseph had said there was famine in every land but in the whole land of egypt there was food when the whole land of egypt was stricken with famine the people cried out to pharaoh for food pharaoh told all egypt go to joseph and do whatever he tells you now the famine had spread across the whole region so joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the egyptians for the famine was severe in the land of egypt every land came to joseph in egypt to buy grain for the famine was severe in every land joseph s brothers in egypt when jacob learned that there was grain in egypt he said to his sons why do you keep looking at each other listen he went on i have heard there is grain in egypt go down there and buy some for us so that we will live and not die so ten of joseph s brothers went down to buy grain from egypt but jacob did not send joseph s brother benjamin with his brothers for he thought something might happen to him the sons of israel were among those who came to buy grain for the famine was in the land of canaan joseph was in charge of the country he sold grain to all its people his brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground when joseph saw his brothers he recognized them but he treated them like strangers and spoke harshly to them where do you come from he asked from the land of canaan to buy food they replied although joseph recognized his brothers they did not recognize him joseph remembered his dreams about them and said to them you are spies you have come to see the weakness h of the land no my lord your servants have come to buy food they said we are all sons of one man we are honest your servants are not spies no he said to them you have come to see the weakness of the land but they replied we your servants were twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of canaan the youngest is now i with our father and one is no longer living then joseph said to them i have spoken j you are spies this is how you will be tested as surely as pharaoh lives you will not leave a lit will kiss your mouth b lit only

your brother the rest of you will be imprisoned so that your words can be tested to see if they are true if they are not then as surely as pharaoh lives you are spies so joseph imprisoned them together for three days on the third day joseph said to them i fear god do this and you will live if you are honest let one of you a be confined to the guardhouse while the rest of you go and take grain to relieve the hunger of your households bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be confirmed then you won t die and they consented to this then they said to each other obviously we are being punished for what we did to our brother we saw his deep distress when he pleaded with us but we would not listen that is why this trouble has come to us but reuben replied didn t i tell you not to harm the boy but you wouldn t listen now we must account for his blood b they did not realize that joseph understood them since there was an interpreter between them he turned away from them and wept when he turned back and spoke to them he took simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain return each man s silver to his sack and give them provisions for their journey this order was carried out they loaded the grain on their donkeys and left there the brothers return home at the place where they lodged for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey and he saw his silver there at the top of his bag he said to his brothers my silver has been returned it s here in my bag their hearts sank trembling they turned to one another and said what is this that god has done to us when they reached their father jacob in the land of canaan they told him all that had happened to them the man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country but we told him we are honest and not spies we were twelve brothers sons of the same c father one is no longer living and the youngest is now with our father in the land of canaan the man who is the lord of the country said to us this is how i will know if you are honest leave one brother with me take food to relieve the hunger of your households and go bring back your youngest brother to me and i will know that you are not spies but honest men i will then give your brother back to you and you can trade in the country as they began emptying their sacks there in each man s sack was his bag of silver when they and their father saw their bags of silver they were afraid their father jacob said to them it s me that you make childless joseph is gone and simeon is gone now you want to take benjamin everything happens to me then reuben said to his father you can kill my two sons if i don t bring him back to you put him in my care d and i will return him to you but jacob answered my son will not go down with you for his brother is dead and he alone is left if anything happens to him on your journey you will bring my gray hairs down to sheol in sorrow decision to return to egypt now the famine in the land was severe when they had used up the grain they had brought back from egypt their father said to them go back and buy us a little food but judah said to him the man specifically warned us you will not see me again unless your brother is with you if you will send our brother with us we will go down and buy food for you but if you will not send him we will not go for the man said to us you will not see me again unless your brother is with you why have you caused me so much trouble israel asked why did you tell the man that you had another brother they answered the man kept asking about us and our family is your father still alive do you have another brother and we answered him accordingly how could we know that he would say bring your brother here then judah said to his father israel send the boy with me we will be on our way so that we may live and not die neither we nor you nor our dependents i will be responsible for him you can hold me personally accountable e a lit your brothers b lit even his blood is being sought c lit of our d lit hand e lit can seek him from my hand genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm if i do not bring him back to you and set him before you i will be guilty before you forever if we had not delayed we could have come back twice by now then their father israel said to them if it must be so then do this put some of the best products of the land in your packs and take them down to the man as a gift a little balsam and a little honey aromatic gum and resin pistachios and almonds take twice as much silver with you return the silver that was returned to you in the top of your bags perhaps it was a mistake take your brother also and go back at once to the man may god almighty cause the man to be merciful to you so that he will release your other brother and benjamin to you as for me if i am deprived of my sons then i am deprived the return to egypt the men took this gift double the amount of silver and benjamin they immediately went down to egypt and stood before joseph when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to his steward take the men to my house slaughter an animal and prepare it for they will eat with me at noon the man did as joseph had said and brought them to joseph s house but the men were afraid because they were taken to joseph s house they said we have been brought here because of the silver that was returned in our bags the first time they intend to overpower us seize us make us slaves and take our donkeys so they approached joseph s steward a and spoke to him at the doorway of the house they said my lord we really did come down here the first time only to buy food when we came to the place where we lodged for the night and opened our bags of grain each one s silver was at the top of his bag it was the full amount of our silver and we have brought it back with us we have brought additional silver with us to buy food we don t know who put our silver in the bags then the steward said may you be well don t be afraid your god and the god of your father must have put treasure in your bags i received your silver then he brought simeon out to them the steward brought the men into joseph s house gave them water to wash their feet and got feed for their donkeys since the men had heard that they were going to eat a meal there they prepared their gift for joseph s arrival at noon when joseph came home they brought him the gift they had carried into the house and they bowed to the ground before him he asked if they were well and he said how is your elderly father that you told me about is he still alive they answered your servant our father is well he is still alive and they knelt low and paid homage to him when he looked up and saw his brother benjamin his mother s son he asked is this your youngest brother that you told me about then he said may god be gracious to you my son joseph hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother and he was about to weep he went into an inner room and wept there then he washed his face and came out regaining his composure he said serve the meal they served him by himself his brothers by themselves and the egyptians who were eating with him by themselves because egyptians could not eat with hebrews since that is detestable to them they were seated before him in order by age from the firstborn to the youngest the men looked at each other in astonishment portions were served to them from joseph s table and benjamin s portion was five times larger than any of theirs they drank and became drunk with joseph joseph s final test joseph commanded his steward fill the men s bags with as much food as they can carry and put each one s silver at the top of his bag put my cup the silver one at the top of the youngest one s bag along with the silver for his grain so he did as joseph told him at morning light the men were sent off with their donkeys they had not gone very far from the city when joseph said to his steward get up pursue the men and when you overtake them say to them why have you repaid evil for good isn t this the cup that my master drinks from and uses for divination what you have done is wrong when he overtook them he said these words to them they said to him why does my lord say these things your servants could a lit approached the one who was over the house genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm not possibly do such a thing we even brought back to you from the land of canaan the silver we found at the top of our bags how could we steal silver or gold from your master s house if it is found with one of us your servants he must die and the rest of us will become my lord s slaves the steward replied what you have said is right but only the one who is found to have it will be my slave and the rest of you will be blameless so each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it the steward searched beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest and the cup was found in benjamin s sack then they tore their clothes and each one loaded his donkey and returned to the city when judah and his brothers reached joseph s house he was still there they fell to the ground before him what is this you have done joseph said to them didn t you know that a man like me could uncover the truth by divination what can we say to my lord judah replied how can we plead how can we justify ourselves god has exposed your servants iniquity we are now my lord s slaves both we and the one in whose possession the cup was found then joseph said i swear that i will not do this the man in whose possession the cup was found will be my slave the rest of you can go in peace to your father judah s plea for benjamin but judah approached him and said my lord please let your servant speak personally to my lord a do not be angry with your servant for you are like pharaoh my lord asked his servants do you have a father or a brother and we answered my lord we have an elderly father and a younger brother the child of his old age the boy s brother is dead he is the only one of his mother s sons left and his father loves him then you said to your servants bring him to me so that i can see him but we said to my lord the boy cannot leave his father if he were to leave his father would die then you said to your servants if your younger brother does not come down with you you will not see me again this is what happened when we went back to your servant my father we reported to him the words of my lord but our father said go again and buy us a little food we told him we cannot go down unless our younger brother goes with us if our younger brother isn t with us we cannot see the man your servant my father said to us you know that my wife bore me two sons one is gone from me i said he must have been torn to pieces and i have never seen him again if you also take this one from me and anything happens to him you will bring my gray hairs down to sheol in sorrow so if i come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us his life is wrapped up with the boy s life when he sees that the boy is not with us he will die then your servants will have brought the gray hairs of your servant our father down to sheol in sorrow your servant became accountable to my father for the boy saying if i do not return him to you i will always bear the guilt for sinning against you my father now please let your servant remain here as my lord s slave in place of the boy let him go back with his brothers for how can i go back to my father without the boy i could not bear to see the grief that would overwhelm my father joseph reveals his identity joseph could no longer keep his composure in front of all his attendants b so he called out send everyone away from me no one was with him when he revealed his identity to his brothers but he wept so loudly that the egyptians heard it and also pharaoh s household heard it joseph said to his brothers i am joseph is my father still living but they could not answer him because they were terrified in his presence then joseph said to his brothers please come near me and they came near i am joseph your brother he said the one you sold into egypt and now don t be grieved or angry with yourselves for selling me here because god sent me ahead of you to preserve life for the famine has been in the land these two years and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting god sent me ahead of you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a great deliverance c therefore it was not you who sent me here but god a lit speak a word in my lord s ears b lit all those standing about him c or keep alive for you many survivors genesis - csb_pew_bible indb pm he has made me a father to pharaoh lord of his entire household and ruler over all the land of egypt return

children and your grandchildren your flocks your herds and all you have there i will sustain you for there will be five more years of famine otherwise you your household and everything you have will become destitute look your eyes and the eyes of my brother benjamin can see that i m a the one speaking to you tell my father about all my glory in egypt and about all you have seen and bring my father here quickly then joseph threw his arms around his brother benjamin and wept and benjamin wept on his shoulder joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept b and afterward his brothers talked with him the return for jacob when the news reached pharaoh s palace joseph s brothers have come pharaoh and his servants were pleased pharaoh said to joseph tell your brothers do this load your animals and go on back to the land of canaan get your father and your families and come back to me i will give you the best of the land of egypt and you can eat from the richness of the land you are also commanded to tell them do this take wagons from the land of egypt for your dependents and your wives and bring your father here do not be concerned about your belongings for the best of all the land of egypt is yours the sons of israel did this joseph gave them wagons as pharaoh had commanded and he gave them provisions for the journey he gave each of the brothers changes of clothes but he gave benjamin three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothes he sent his father the following ten donkeys carrying the best products of egypt and ten female donkeys carrying grain food and provisions for his father on the journey so joseph sent his brothers on their way and as they were leaving he said to them don t argue c on the way so they went up from egypt and came to their father jacob in the land of canaan they said joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of egypt jacob was stunned d for he did not believe them but when they told jacob all that joseph had said to them and when he saw the wagons that joseph had sent to transport him the spirit of their father jacob revived then israel said enough my son joseph is still alive i will go to see him before i die jacob leaves for egypt israel set out with all that he had and came to beer- sheba and he offered sacrifices to the god of his father isaac that night god spoke to israel in a vision jacob jacob he said and jacob replied here i am god said i am god the god of your father do not be afraid to go down to egypt for i will make you into a great nation there i will go down with you to egypt and i will also bring you back joseph will close your eyes when you die e jacob left beer- sheba the sons of israel took their father jacob in the wagons pharaoh had sent to carry him along with their dependents and their wives they also took their cattle and possessions they had acquired in the land of canaan then jacob and all his offspring with him came to egypt his sons and grandsons his daughters and

at goshen when they came to the land of goshen joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and went up to goshen to meet his father israel joseph presented himself to him threw his arms around him and wept for a long time then israel said to joseph i m ready to die now because i have seen your face and you are still alive joseph said to his brothers and to his father s family i will go up and inform pharaoh telling him my brothers and my father s family who were in the land of canaan have come to me the men are shepherds they also raise livestock they have brought their flocks and herds and all that they have when pharaoh addresses you and asks what is your occupation you are to say your servants both we and our fathers have raised livestock i from our youth until now then you will be allowed to settle in the land of goshen since all shepherds are detestable to egyptians pharaoh welcomes jacob so joseph went and informed pharaoh my father and my brothers with their flocks and herds and all that they own have come from the land of canaan and are now in the land of goshen he took five of his brothers and presented them to pharaoh and pharaoh asked his brothers what is your occupation they said to pharaoh your servants both we and our fathers are shepherds and they said to pharaoh we have come to stay in the land for a while because there is no grazing land for your servants sheep since the famine in the land of canaan has been severe so now please let your servants settle in the land of goshen then pharaoh said to joseph now that your father and brothers have come to you the land of egypt is open before you settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land they can live in the land of goshen if you know of any capable men among them put them in charge of my livestock joseph then brought his father jacob and presented him to pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh pharaoh said to jacob how many years have you lived jacob said to pharaoh my

my fathers during their pilgrimages so jacob blessed pharaoh and departed from pharaoh s presence then joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded and joseph provided his father his brothers and all his father s family with food for their dependents the land becomes pharaoh s but there was no food in the entire region for the famine was very severe the land of egypt and the land of canaan were exhausted by the famine joseph collected all the silver to be found in the land of egypt and the land of canaan in exchange for the grain they were purchasing and he brought the silver to pharaoh s palace when the silver from the land of egypt and the land of canaan was gone all the egyptians came to joseph and said give us food why should we die here in front of you the silver is gone but joseph said give me your livestock since the silver is gone i will give you food in exchange for your livestock so they brought their livestock to joseph and he gave them food in exchange for the horses the flocks of sheep the herds of cattle and the donkeys that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock when that year was over they came the next year and said to him we cannot hide from our lord that the silver is gone and that all our livestock belongs to our lord there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land why should we die here in front of you both us and our land buy us and our land in exchange for food then we with our land will become pharaoh s slaves give us seed so that we can live and not die and so that the land won t become desolate in this way joseph acquired all the land in egypt for pharaoh because every egyptian sold his field since the famine was so severe for them the land became pharaoh s and joseph moved the people to the cities a from one end of egypt to the other the only land he did not acquire belonged to the priests for they had an allowance from pharaoh they ate from their allowance that pharaoh gave them therefore they did not sell their land joseph said to the people understand today that i have acquired you and your land for pharaoh here is seed for you sow it in the land at harvest you are to give a fifth of it to pharaoh and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and as food for yourselves your households and your dependents you have saved our lives they said we have found favor with our lord and will be pharaoh s slaves so joseph made it a law still in effect today in the land of egypt that a fifth of the produce belongs to pharaoh only the priests land does not belong to pharaoh israel settles in goshen israel settled in the land of egypt in the region of goshen they acquired property in it and became fruitful and very numerous now jacob lived in the land of egypt years and his life span was years when the time approached for him to die he called his son joseph and said to him if i have found favor with you put your hand under my thigh and promise me that you will deal with me in kindness and faithfulness do not bury me in egypt when i rest with my fathers carry me away from egypt and bury me in their burial place joseph answered i will do what you have asked and jacob said swear to me so joseph swore to him then israel bowed in thanks at the head of his bed b jacob blesses ephraim and manasseh some time after this joseph was told your father is weaker so he set out with his two sons manasseh and ephraim when jacob was told your son joseph has come to you israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me he said to me i will make you fruitful and numerous i will make many nations come from you and i will give this land as a permanent possession to your future descendants your two sons born to you in the land of egypt before i came to you in egypt are now mine ephraim and manasseh belong to me just as reuben and simeon do children born to you after them will be yours and will be recorded under the names a sam lxx vg read and he made the

sorrow rachel died along the way some distance from ephrath in the land of canaan i buried her there along the way to ephrath that is bethlehem when israel saw joseph s sons he said who are these and joseph said to his father they are my sons god has given me here so israel said bring them to me and i will bless them now his eyesight was poor because of old age he could hardly a see joseph brought them to him and he kissed and embraced them israel said to joseph i never expected to see your face again but now god has even let me see your offspring then joseph took them from his father s knees and bowed with his face to the ground ephraim s greater blessing then joseph took them both with his right hand ephraim toward israel s left and with his left hand manasseh toward israel s right and brought them to israel but israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of ephraim the younger and crossing his hands put his left on manasseh s head although manasseh was the firstborn then he blessed joseph and said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has been my shepherd all my life to this day the angel who has redeemed me from all harm may he bless these boys and may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers abraham and isaac and may they grow to be numerous within the land when joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on ephraim s head he thought it was a mistake b and took his father s hand to move it from ephraim s head to manasseh s joseph said to his father not that way my father this one is the firstborn put your right hand on his head but his father refused and said i know my son i know he too will become a tribe c and he too will be great nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he and his offspring will become a populous nation d so he blessed them that day putting ephraim before manasseh when he said the nation israel will invoke blessings by you saying may god make you like ephraim and manasseh israel said to joseph look i am about to die but god will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers over and above what i am giving your brothers i am giving

rebekah are buried there and i buried leah there the field and the cave in it were purchased from the hethites when jacob had finished giving charges to his sons he drew his feet into the bed took his last breath and was gathered to his people jacob s burial then joseph leaning over his father s face wept and kissed him he commanded his servants who were physicians to embalm his father so they embalmed israel they took forty days to complete this for embalming takes that long and the egyptians mourned for him seventy days when the days of mourning were over joseph said to pharaoh s

joseph s family his brothers and his father s family only their dependents their flocks and their herds were left in the land of goshen horses and chariots went up with him it was a very impressive procession when they reached the threshing floor of atad which is across the jordan they lamented and wept loudly and joseph mourned seven days for his father when the canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of atad they said this is a solemn mourning on the part of the egyptians therefore the place is named abel-mizraim a it is across the jordan so jacob s sons did for him what he had commanded them they carried him to the land of canaan and buried him in the cave at machpelah in the field near mamre which abraham had purchased as burial property from ephron the hethite after joseph buried his father he returned to egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father joseph s kindness when joseph s brothers saw that their father was dead they said to one another if joseph is holding a grudge against us he will certainly repay us for all the suffering we caused him so they sent this message to joseph before he died your father gave a command say this to joseph please forgive your brothers transgression and their sin the suffering they caused you therefore please forgive the transgression of the servants of the god of your father joseph wept when their message came to him his brothers also came to him bowed down before him and said we are your slaves but joseph said to them don t be afraid am i in the place of god you planned evil against me god planned it for good to bring about the present result the survival of many people therefore don t be afraid i will take care of you and your children and he comforted them

number of jacob s descendants a was seventy b joseph was already in egypt joseph and all his brothers and all that generation eventually died but the israelites were fruitful increased rapidly multiplied and became extremely numerous so that the land was filled with them a new king who did not know about joseph came to power in egypt he said to his people look the israelite people are more numerous and powerful than we are come let s deal shrewdly with them otherwise they will multiply further and when war breaks out they will join our enemies fight against us and leave the country so the egyptians assigned taskmasters over the israelites to oppress them with forced labor they built pithom and rameses as supply cities for pharaoh but the more they oppressed them the more they multiplied and spread so that the egyptians came to dread c the israelites they worked the israelites ruthlessly and made their lives bitter with difficult labor in brick and mortar and in all kinds of fieldwork they ruthlessly imposed all this work on them the king of egypt said to the hebrew midwives the first whose name was shiphrah and the second whose name was puah when you help the hebrew women give birth observe them as they deliver if the child is a son kill him but if it s a daughter she may live the midwives however feared god and did not do as the king of egypt had told them they let the boys live so the king of egypt summoned the midwives and asked them why have you done this and let the boys live the midwives said to pharaoh the hebrew women are not like the egyptian women for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them so god was good to the midwives and the people multiplied and became very numerous since the midwives feared god he gave them families pharaoh then commanded all his people you must throw every son born to the hebrews into the nile but let every daughter live moses s birth and adoption now a man from the family of levi married a levite woman the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son when she saw that he was beautiful d she hid him for three months but when she could no longer hide him she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with asphalt and pitch she placed the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the nile then his sister stood at a distance in order to see what would happen to him pharaoh s daughter went down to bathe at the nile while her servant girls walked along the riverbank she saw the basket among the reeds sent her slave girl took it opened it and saw him the child and there he was a little boy crying she felt sorry for him and said this is one of the hebrew boys then his sister said to pharaoh s daughter should i go and call a hebrew woman who is nursing to nurse the boy for you go pharaoh s daughter told her so the girl went and called the boy s mother then pharaoh s daughter said to her take this child and nurse him for me and i will pay your wages so the woman took the boy and nursed him when the child grew older she brought him to pharaoh s daughter and he became her son she named him moses e because she said i drew him out of the water moses

attacking your neighbor a who made you a commander and judge over us the man replied are you planning to kill me as you killed the egyptian then moses became afraid and thought what i did is certainly known when pharaoh heard about this he tried to kill moses but moses fled from pharaoh and went to live in the land of midian and sat down by a well now the priest of midian had seven daughters they came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father s flock then some shepherds arrived and drove them away but moses came to their rescue and watered their flock when they returned to their father reuel b he asked why have you come back so quickly today they answered an egyptian rescued us from the shepherds he even drew water for us and watered the flock so where is he he asked his daughters why then did you leave the man behind invite him to eat dinner moses agreed to stay with the man and he gave his daughter zipporah to moses in marriage she gave birth to a son whom he named gershom c for he said i have been a resident alien in a foreign land after a long time the king of egypt died the israelites groaned because of their difficult labor and they cried out and their cry for help because of the difficult labor ascended to god and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god saw the israelites and god knew moses and the burning bush meanwhile moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law jethro d the priest of midian he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to horeb e the mountain of god then the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire within a bush as moses looked he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed so moses thought i must go over and look at this remarkable sight why isn t the bush burning up when the lord saw that he had gone over to look god called out to him from the bush moses moses here i am he answered do not come closer he said remove the sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy ground then he continued i am the god of your father f the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at god then the lord said i have observed the misery of my people in egypt and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors i know about their sufferings and i have come down to rescue them from the power of the egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land a land flowing with milk and honey the territory of the canaanites hethites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites so because the israelites cry for help has come to me and i have also seen the way the egyptians are oppressing them therefore go i am sending you to pharaoh so that you may lead my people the israelites out of egypt but moses asked god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and that i should bring the israelites out of egypt he answered i will certainly be with you and this will be the sign to you that i am the one who sent you when you bring the people out of egypt you will all worship g god at this mountain then moses asked god if i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name what should i tell them god replied to moses i am who i am h this is what you are to say to the israelites i am has sent me to you god also said to moses say this to the israelites the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of

lord the god of the hebrews has met with us now please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the lord our god however i know that the king of egypt will not allow you to go even under force from a strong hand but when i stretch out my hand and strike egypt with all my miracles that i will perform in it after that he will let you go and i will give these people such favor with the egyptians that when you go you will not go empty-handed each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing and you will put them on your sons and daughters so you will plunder the egyptians miraculous signs for moses moses answered what if they won t believe me and will not obey me but say the lord did not appear to you the lord asked him what is that in your hand a staff he replied throw it on the ground he said so moses threw it on the ground it became a snake and he ran from it the lord told moses stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail so he stretched out his hand and caught it and it became a staff in his hand this will take place he continued so that they will believe that the lord the god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has appeared to you in addition the lord said to him put your hand inside your cloak so he put his hand inside his cloak and when he took it out his hand was diseased resembling snow a put your hand back inside your cloak he said so he put his hand back inside his cloak and when he took it out it had again become like the rest of his skin if they will not believe you and will not respond to the evidence of the first sign they may believe the evidence of the second sign and if they don t believe even these two signs or listen to what you say take some water from the nile and pour it on the dry ground the water you take from the nile will become blood on the ground but moses replied to the lord please lord i have never been eloquent either in the past or recently or since you have been speaking to your servant because my mouth and my tongue are sluggish b the lord said to him who placed a mouth on humans who

and see if they are still living jethro said to moses go in peace now in midian the lord told moses return to egypt for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead so moses took his wife and sons put

have put within your power but i will harden his heart f so that he won t let the people go and you will say to pharaoh this is what the lord says israel is my firstborn son i told you let my son go

overnight campsite it happened that the lord confronted him and intended to put him to death so zipporah took a flint cut off her son s foreskin threw it at moses s feet and said you are a bridegroom of blood to me so he let him alone at that time she said you are a bridegroom of blood referring to the circumcision reunion of moses and aaron now the lord had said to aaron go and meet moses in the wilderness so he went and met him at the mountain of god and kissed him moses told aaron everything the lord had sent him to say and about all the signs he had commanded him to do then moses and aaron went and assembled all the elders of the israelites aaron repeated everything the lord had said to moses and performed the signs before the people the people believed and when they heard that the lord had paid attention to them and that he had seen their misery they knelt low and worshiped moses confronts pharaoh later moses and aaron went in and said to pharaoh this is what the lord the god of israel says let my people go so that they may hold a festival for me in the wilderness but pharaoh responded who is the lord that i should obey him by letting israel go i don t know a the lord and besides i will not let israel go they answered the god of the hebrews has met with us please let us go on a threeday trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the lord our god or else he may strike us with plague or sword the king of egypt said to them moses and aaron why are you causing the people to neglect their work get to your labor pharaoh also said look the people of the land are so numerous and you would stop them from their labor further oppression of israel that day pharaoh commanded the overseers of the people as well as their foremen don t continue to supply the people with straw for making bricks as before they must go and gather straw for themselves but require the same quota of bricks from them as they were making before do not reduce it for they are slackers that is why they are crying out let us go and sacrifice to our god impose heavier work on the men then they will be occupied with it and not pay attention to deceptive words so the overseers and foremen of the people went out and said to them this is what pharaoh says i am not giving you straw go get straw yourselves wherever you can find it but there will be no reduction at all in your workload so the people scattered throughout the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw the overseers insisted finish your assigned work each day just as you did when straw was provided then the israelite foremen whom pharaoh s slave drivers had set over the people were beaten and asked why haven t you finished making your prescribed number of bricks yesterday or today as you did before so the israelite foremen went in and cried for help to pharaoh why are you treating your servants this way no straw has been given to your servants yet they say to us make bricks look your servants are being beaten but it is your own people who are at fault but he said you are slackers slackers that is why you are saying let us go sacrifice to the lord now get to work no straw will be given to you but you must produce the same quantity of bricks the israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told you cannot reduce your daily quota of bricks when they left pharaoh they confronted moses and aaron who stood waiting to meet them may the lord take note of you and judge they said to them because you have made us reek to pharaoh and his officials putting a sword in their hand to kill us so moses went back to the lord and asked lord why have you caused trouble for this people and why did you ever send me ever since i went in to pharaoh to speak in your name he has caused trouble for this people and you haven t rescued your people at all but the lord replied to moses now you will see what i will do to pharaoh because of a strong hand he will let them go and because of a strong hand he will drive them from his land a or recognize exodus - csb_pew_bible indb pm god promises freedom then god spoke to moses telling him i am the lord i appeared to abraham isaac and jacob as god almighty but i was not known to them by my name the lord a i also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land they lived in as aliens furthermore i have heard the groaning of the israelites whom the egyptians are forcing to work as slaves and i have remembered my covenant therefore tell the israelites i am the lord and i will bring you out from the forced labor of the egyptians and rescue you from slavery to them i will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great acts of judgment i will take you as my people and i will be your god you will know that i am the lord your god who brought you out from the forced labor of the egyptians i will bring you to the land that i swore b to give to abraham isaac and jacob and i will give it to you as a possession i am the lord moses told this to the israelites but they did not listen to him because of their broken spirit and hard labor then the lord spoke to moses go and tell pharaoh king of egypt to let the israelites go from his land but moses said in the lord s presence if the israelites will not listen to me then how will pharaoh listen to me since i am such a poor speaker c then the lord spoke to moses and aaron and gave them commands concerning both the israelites and pharaoh king of egypt to bring the israelites out of the land of egypt genealogy of moses and aaron these are the heads of their fathers families the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these are the clans of reuben the sons of simeon jemuel jamin ohad jachin zohar and shaul

israelites out of the land of egypt according to their military divisions moses and aaron were the ones who spoke to pharaoh king of egypt in order to bring the israelites out of egypt moses and aaron before pharaoh on the day the lord spoke to moses in the land of egypt he said to him i am the lord tell pharaoh king of egypt everything i am telling you but moses replied in the lord s presence since i am such a poor speaker how will pharaoh listen to me the lord answered moses see i have made you like god to pharaoh and aaron your brother will be your prophet you must say a lord in small capitals stands for the personal name of god which in hb is yahweh there is a long tradition of substituting lord for yahweh out of reverence b lit raised my hand c lit i have uncircumcised lips also in v exodus - csb_pew_bible indb pm whatever i command you then aaron your brother must declare it to pharaoh so that he will let the israelites go from his land but i will harden pharaoh s heart and multiply my signs and wonders in the land of egypt pharaoh will not listen to you but i will put my hand into egypt and bring the military divisions of my people the israelites out of the land of egypt by great acts of judgment the egyptians will know that i am the lord when i stretch out my hand against egypt and bring out the israelites from among them so moses and aaron did this they did just as the lord commanded them moses was eighty years old and aaron eighty-three when they spoke to pharaoh the lord said to moses and aaron when pharaoh tells you perform a miracle tell aaron take your staff and throw it down before pharaoh it will become a serpent so moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and did just as the lord had commanded aaron threw down his staff before pharaoh and his officials and it became a serpent but then pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers the magicians of egypt and they also did the same thing by their occult practices each one threw down his staff and it became a serpent but aaron s staff swallowed their staffs however pharaoh s heart was hard and he did not listen to them as the lord had said the first plague water turned to blood then the lord said to moses pharaoh s heart is hard he refuses to let the people go go to pharaoh in the morning when you see him walking out to the water stand ready to meet him by the bank of the nile take in your hand the staff that turned into a snake tell him the lord the god of the hebrews has sent me to tell you let my people go so that they may worship a me in the wilderness but so far you have not listened this is what the lord says here is how you will know that i am the lord watch i am about to strike the water in the nile with the staff in my hand and it will turn to blood the fish in the nile will die the river will stink and the egyptians will be unable to drink water from it so the lord said to moses tell aaron take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of egypt over their rivers canals ponds and all their water reservoirs and they will become blood there will be blood throughout the land of egypt even in wooden and stone containers moses and aaron did just as the lord had commanded in the sight of pharaoh and his officials he raised the staff and struck the water in the nile and all the water in the nile was turned to blood the fish in the nile died and the river smelled so bad the egyptians could not drink water from it there was blood throughout the land of egypt but the magicians of egypt did the same thing by their occult practices so pharaoh s heart was hard and he would not listen to them as the lord had said pharaoh turned around went into his palace and didn t take even this to heart all the egyptians dug around the nile for water to drink because they could not drink the water from the river seven days passed after the lord struck the nile the second plague frogs then the lord said to moses go in to pharaoh and tell him this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship me but if you refuse to let them go then i will plague all your territory with frogs the nile will swarm with frogs they will come up and go into your palace into your bedroom and on your bed into the houses of your officials and your people and into your ovens and kneading bowls the frogs will come up on you your people and all your officials the lord then said to moses tell aaron stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers canals and ponds and cause the frogs to come up onto the land of egypt when aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt but the magicians did the same thing by their occult practices and brought frogs up onto the land of egypt pharaoh summoned moses and aaron and said appeal to the lord to remove the frogs from me and my people then i will let the people go and they can sacrifice to the lord moses said to pharaoh you may have the honor of choosing when should i appeal on behalf of you your officials and your people that the frogs be taken away from you and your houses and remain only in the nile tomorrow he answered a or serve ex exodus - csb_pew_bible indb pm moses replied as you have said so that you may know there is no one like the lord our god the frogs will go away from you your houses your officials and your people the frogs will remain only in the nile after moses and aaron went out from pharaoh moses cried out to the lord for help concerning the frogs that he had brought against pharaoh the lord did as moses had said the frogs in the houses courtyards and fields died they piled them in countless heaps and there was a terrible odor in the land but when pharaoh saw there was relief he hardened his heart and would not listen to them as the lord had said the third plague gnats then the lord said to moses tell aaron stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the land and it will become gnats a throughout the land of egypt and they did this aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and when he struck the dust of the land gnats were on people and animals all the dust of the land became gnats throughout the land of egypt the magicians tried to produce gnats using their occult practices but they could not the gnats remained on people and animals this is the finger of god the magicians said to pharaoh but pharaoh s heart was hard and he would not listen to them as the lord had said the fourth plague swarms of flies the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and present yourself to pharaoh when you see him going out to the water tell him this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship b me but if you will not let my people go then i will send swarms of flies c against you your officials your people and your houses the egyptians houses will swarm with flies and so will the land where they live d but on that day i will give special treatment to the land of goshen where my people are living no flies will be there this way you will know that i the lord am in the land i will make a distinction e between my people and your people this sign will take place tomorrow and the lord did this thick swarms of flies went into pharaoh s palace and his officials houses throughout egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies then pharaoh summoned moses and aaron and said go sacrifice to your god within the country but moses said it would not be right f to do that because what we will sacrifice to the lord our god is detestable to the egyptians if we sacrifice what the egyptians detest in front of them won t they stone us we must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he instructs us pharaoh responded i will let you go and sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness but don t go very far make an appeal for me as soon as i leave you moses said i will appeal to the lord and tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from pharaoh his officials and his people but pharaoh must not act deceptively again by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the lord then moses left pharaoh s presence and appealed to the lord the lord did as moses had said he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh his officials and his people not one was left but pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go the fifth plague death of livestock then the lord said to moses go in to pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may worship me but if you refuse to let them go and keep holding them then the lord s hand will bring a severe plague against your livestock in the field the horses donkeys camels herds and flocks but the lord will make a distinction between the livestock of israel and the livestock of egypt so that nothing of all that the israelites own will die and the lord set a time saying tomorrow the lord will do this thing in the land the lord did this the next day all the egyptian livestock died but none among the israelite livestock died pharaoh sent messengers who saw that not a single one of the israelite livestock was dead but pharaoh s heart was hard and he did not let the people go the sixth plague boils then the lord said to moses and aaron take handfuls of furnace soot and moses

moses threw it toward heaven and it became festering boils on people and animals the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the egyptians but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he did not listen to them as the lord had told moses the seventh plague hail then the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and present yourself to pharaoh tell him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may worship me for this time i am about to send all my plagues against you a your officials and your people then you will know there is no one like me on the whole earth by now i could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague and you would have been obliterated from the earth however i have let you live for this purpose to show you my power and to make my name known on the whole earth you are still acting arrogantly against b my people by not letting them go tomorrow at this time i will rain down the worst hail that has ever occurred in egypt from the day it was founded until now therefore give orders to bring your livestock and all that you have in the field into shelters every person and animal that is in the field and not brought inside will die when the hail falls on them those among pharaoh s officials who feared the word of the lord made their servants and livestock flee to shelters but those who didn t take to heart the lord s word left their servants and livestock in the field then the lord said to moses stretch out your hand toward heaven and let there be hail throughout the land of egypt on people and animals and every plant of the field in the land of egypt so moses stretched out his staff toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail lightning struck the land and the lord rained hail on the land of egypt the hail with lightning flashing through it was so severe that nothing like it had occurred in the land of egypt since it had become a nation throughout the land of egypt the hail struck down everything in the field both people and animals the hail beat down every plant of the field and shattered every tree in the field the only place it didn t hail was in the land of goshen where the israelites were pharaoh sent for moses and aaron i have sinned this time he said to them the lord is the righteous one and i and my people are the guilty ones make an appeal to the lord there has been enough of god s thunder and hail i will let you go you don t need to stay any longer moses said to him when i have left the city i will spread out my hands to the lord the thunder will cease and there will be no more hail so that you may know the earth c belongs to the lord but as for you and your officials i know that you still do not fear the lord god the flax and the barley were destroyed because the barley was ripe d and the flax was budding but the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed since they are later crops e moses left pharaoh and the city and spread out his hands to the lord then the thunder and hail ceased and rain no longer poured down on the land when pharaoh saw that the rain hail and thunder had ceased he sinned again and hardened his heart he and his officials so pharaoh s heart was hard and he did not let the israelites go as the lord had said through moses the eighth plague locusts then the lord said to moses go to pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that i may do these miraculous signs of mine among them f and so that you may tell g your son and grandson how severely i dealt with the egyptians and performed miraculous signs among them and you will know that i am the lord so moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and told him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says how long will you refuse to humble yourself before me let my people go that they may worship me but if you refuse to let my people go then tomorrow i will

growing in the fields they will fill your houses all your officials houses and the houses of all the egyptians something your fathers and grandfathers never saw since the time they occupied the land until today then he turned and left pharaoh s presence pharaoh s officials asked him how long must this man be a snare to us let the men go so that they may worship the lord their god don t you realize yet that egypt is devastated so moses and aaron were brought back to pharaoh go worship the lord your god pharaoh said but exactly who will be going moses replied we will go with our young and with our old we will go with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds because we must hold the lord s festival he said to them the lord would have to be with you if i would ever let you and your families go look out you re heading for trouble no go just able-bodied men worship the lord since that s what you want and they were driven from pharaoh s presence the lord then said to moses stretch out your hand over the land of egypt and the locusts will come up over it and eat every plant in the land everything that the hail left so moses stretched out his staff over the land of egypt and the lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and through the night by morning the east wind had brought in the locusts the locusts went up over the entire land of egypt and settled on the whole territory of egypt never before had there been such a large number of locusts and there never will be again they covered the surface of the whole land so that the land was black and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left nothing green was left on the trees or the plants in the field throughout the land of egypt pharaoh urgently sent for moses and aaron and said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you please forgive my sin once more and make an appeal to the lord your god so that he will just take this death away from me moses left pharaoh s presence and appealed to the lord then the lord changed the wind to a strong west a wind and it carried off the locusts and blew them into the red sea not a single locust was left in all the territory of egypt but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he did not let the israelites go the ninth plague darkness then the lord said to moses stretch out your hand toward heaven and there will be darkness over the land of egypt a darkness that can be felt so moses stretched out his hand toward heaven and there was thick darkness throughout the land of egypt for three days one person could not see another and for three days they did not move from where they were yet all the israelites had light where they lived pharaoh summoned moses and said go worship the lord even your families may go with you only your flocks and herds must stay behind moses responded you must also let us have b sacrifices and burnt offerings to prepare for the lord our god even our livestock must go with us not a hoof will be left behind because we will take some of them to worship the lord our god we will not know what we will use to worship the lord until we get there but the lord hardened pharaoh s heart and he was unwilling to let them go pharaoh said to him leave me make sure you never see my face again for on the day you see my face you will die as you have said moses replied i will never see your face again the tenth plague death of the firstborn the lord said c to moses i will bring one more plague on pharaoh and on egypt after that he will let you go from

worship the lord as you have said take even your flocks and your herds as you asked and leave and also bless me now the egyptians pressured the people in order to send them quickly out of the country for they said we re all going to die so the people took their dough before it was leavened with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their clothes on their shoulders the israelites acted on moses s word and asked the egyptians for silver and gold items and for clothing and the lord gave the people such favor with the egyptians that they gave them what they requested in this way they plundered the egyptians the israelites traveled from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand able-bodied men on foot besides their families a mixed crowd also went up with them along with a huge number of livestock both flocks and herds the people baked the dough they had brought out of egypt into unleavened loaves since it had no yeast for when they were driven out of egypt they could not delay and
